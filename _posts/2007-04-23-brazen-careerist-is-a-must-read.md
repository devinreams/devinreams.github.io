One of my favorite blogs to read is is called [Brazen Careerist, by Penelope Trunk.][1] She&#8217;s a syndicated career columnist that I&#8217;ve been following for a few months now. I point my friends to her articles, cite her ideas in conversation and now I&#8217;ve had a chance to read her new book: [Brazen Careerist: The *New* Rules For Success][2].

<!--more-->

The book is organized into 14 chapters with 45 tips. At 200 pages this is a dense and insightful read. Penelope&#8217;s tips are a perfect read for someone like myself (recent graduate or upcoming graduate, someone new to the workforce, millenial, etc.) and some of my favorites include:

> *   Grad School Will Not Save You
> *   Cold-Calling Will Empower You
> *   Do Your Own Work Last
> *   Being Likable Matters More Than Being Competent
> *   Stop Using Adverbs
> *   Networking for Introverts, and
> *   Typecast Yourself

It&#8217;s obvious the workplace is changing. Boomers are moving out, millennials (or Generation Yers) are moving in. What kinds of changes are we instigating? Where will it impact our professional lives? How do we use this change to our advantage? What will the change mean to our personal lives?

All these answers can be found in [Brazen Careerist][2]. If you&#8217;ve read [A Whole New Mind][3] then you&#8217;ve got to read this one, too. If you haven&#8217;t, pick up both. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s the best move for your future (both personally and professionally).
