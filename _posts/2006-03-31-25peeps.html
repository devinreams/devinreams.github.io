I came across a neat site today, <a href="http://25peeps.com/r/692">25peeps.com</a>. People get bored and like pictures, right? Well this site puts up a 5x5 grid of 25 people's pictures and if you like what you see you click and visit their blog. I submitted my site.. I wonder how much traffic it'll send.
