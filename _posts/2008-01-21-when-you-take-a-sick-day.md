&#8230;do you feel:

*   **Guilty** like you&#8217;ve gone and selfishly removed a day&#8217;s worth of productivity
*   **Worried** that you&#8217;ll have so much piled up when you come back
*   **Anxious** because you are so essential people can&#8217;t get by without you
*   **Relaxed** because you&#8217;re helping yourself get better
*   **Semi-productive** because you end up crawling in bed with your laptop and working anyway

or any variation of those? I&#8217;m sick today and have been all weekend. Luckily my firm is of the &#8220;don&#8217;t come to work when you&#8217;re sick, we&#8217;ll still pay you&#8221; mindset.

But, it makes me feel guilty. That guilt leads to semi-productiveness. And that semi-productiveness leads to me sending out emails and putting out as many fires as I can from the comfort of my home. I&#8217;m still getting rest. I have plenty of tissues at hand and I&#8217;m comfortable in my sweatpants.

Unfortunately, I know people who don&#8217;t get (free, unlimited, or any) sick days. Are you one of those? Do you have a laptop you bring home? My suspicion is you don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re not doing guilty work at home like me.
