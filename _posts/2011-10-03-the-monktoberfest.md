I&#8217;m headed to Portland (Maine aka &#8220;real Portland&#8221;) this week for what I believe will be *the* underrated technology (and beer!) conference of the year. Kudos to [Steve][1] et al for pulling together what I&#8217;m sure will be a great time. We have a big &#8220;todo&#8221; list but Let me know if there&#8217;s anything worth seeing out there.
