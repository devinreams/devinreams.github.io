I was browsing the Mac App Store and spotted a new &#8220;Editors Choice&#8221; app from [Mint.com][1]: [Mint QuickView][2]. It&#8217;s a system tray application icon that pops down a &#8216;quick view&#8217; (modeled similar to Fantastical or even Spotlight) of your finances. Spending, recent transactions, net worth, etc.

Rachel and I have over two and a half years of our joint finances at Mint.com and it&#8217;s the best online budgeting, tracking, and personal finance planning tool. It has my unqualified endorsement and the new app is a great addition to the website and mobile apps.
