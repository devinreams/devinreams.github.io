I've seen discussions wondering when the Newsstand functionality will work in the iOS 5 betas. If iOS subscription compliance was due yesterday, and many periodicals have been featured in the App Store lately: I would bet Newsstand support will be flipped on, along with the new store, at the final release. I don't expect any of the developer betas to have this feature available. 

My belief is this is Apple's only feature to encourage content owners to offer subscriptions through in-app purchases and they want to control the launch and publicity behind it, not some loose-lipped developers.
