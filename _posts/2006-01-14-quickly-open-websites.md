I don&#8217;t remember where I stumbled upon these little tricks but I&#8217;ve found myself quite the nifty habit:

Whenever I want to pull up a website (ie, www.devinreams.com) I just type &#8216;devinreams&#8217; in the address bar and hit Ctrl-Enter. Both Firefox and IE fill in the http://www. and .com for you!  
Think of all the time saved!

**Bonus:** Firefox does the same for .net and .org with Shift-Enter and Alt-Enter, respectively! Reason #1837 why Firefox is so much better!

&#8230;ah, who am I kidding? I can&#8217;t think of one top-level site I visit daily that *isn&#8217;t* .com.
