Okay, so I've been keeping a secret from all my readers, I haven't bought a book in over a year. Yet I've probably read 4 or so. "But Devin, how can you read books if you haven't bought any?!" My answer to you is: have you ever heard of the library? Then my second answer to you is: have you ever heard of <a href="http://www.inbubblewrap.com/">inBubbleWrap</a>? It's a side-project brought to you by the great people at <a href="http://800ceoread.com/">800-CEO-READ</a> and it basically functions as a daily drawing for a free book. I've won three so far. I'm in the process of reading <a href="http://800ceoread.com/products/?ISBN=0743257529">China, Inc</a> which I got in the mail a few weeks ago. Another good way to get free books is to ask publishers for a copy in exchange for a review. I've scored another 3 or 4 this way and have a review to post shortly (way overdue). There you have it, my secret is out...
