I think the biggest piece of advice anyone out of college would give is to travel while you're young (and in college). I've heard it a number of times. From friends, family, family friends, professors, etc. Having seen my friends study abroad for months at a time and knowing that my elders are wiser than I, I've realized that it's time for me to travel. So, I'm going to China...

	<!--more-->

	I've been out of the country a few times. Twice to New Zealand and a number of times to Canada. It had been a while since I'd traveled though so here's my first lesson before I even left:

	<h2>Passports take many weeks to be renewed</h2>

	Mom constantly reminded me and I constantly put if off. I then realized I needed my passport back in less than a month and the processing can take up to 8 weeks. Oops. That mistake cost me a few extra bucks to have it expedited.

	<h2>You can't <em>really</em> do your own photo</h2>

	The guidelines for passport photos are all online and very easy to follow. But, little did I know, this is really just a joke. You can't take your own passport photos. They laugh at whatever you bring in. I printed the right size, perfect quality, but nope... don't bother. Pay the extra $15 at the Post Office to get it done.

	<h2>You have to be <em>invited</em> to China</h2>

	I knew that you had to have permission (and good reason) to move to India but I didn't realize you needed an invitation to visit China. I'll be traveling with a tour group so that was obviously taken care of. In any case, I didn't realize a Visa was needed to visit China.

	<h2>Credit cards don't work in China</h2>
	I can leave the Visa, MasterCard and AmEx at home. Despite what the commercials say, these guys are <em>not</em> accepted everywhere. Lots of Traveler's Checks are to be purchased today. As they say, Cash is king.

	So, any last minute advice, tips, anything? I get on the plane early tomorrow morning and I plan to return with great pictures, stories and lessons. Of course, I'll share them all. See you in April...
