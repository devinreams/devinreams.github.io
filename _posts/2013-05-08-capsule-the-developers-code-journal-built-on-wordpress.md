The team at [Crowd Favorite][1] has been working on a solution to a problem a lot of designers and developers (and folks that work with designers and developers) didn&#8217;t quite realize they had: when working on a project you typically take notes on the side&#8230; but you usually throw that away and lose the snippets of code, outlines of todos, open questions and decisions, etc.

> [Capsule][2] replaces that scratch document you have open when you&#8217;re coding. It creates an archive of your development artifacts. 

Instead of keeping a text file open when working on a project, using Capsule means you can have a simple archive of all those notes and easily reference them in the future.

Initial reactions and reception have been very positive from the development and WordPress community so we&#8217;re all very pleased.

Be sure to check out [Alex&#8217;s post on Capsule][3] to read more about the thinking and decisions behind this (free) product.
