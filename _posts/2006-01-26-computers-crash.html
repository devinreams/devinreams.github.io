Why the hell is it that computers will crash and eff up <strong>if and only if </strong>you're in the middle of a pretty important task? Honestly. I was having website issues the other day and then this evening Windows crashed <em>hard</em> (and by hard I mean it rebooted saying it had to do registry recovery, none of my cookies are saved, etc.). This is such a waste of my time. All those days I sit around poking people on Facebook though, nothing! Not even a frozen browser... thanks <a href="http://www.murphys-laws.com/">Murphy</a>.
