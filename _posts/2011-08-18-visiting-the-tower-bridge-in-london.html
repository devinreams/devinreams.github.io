Alex and I arrived in London around mid-day on Tuesday (after flying out at 9 PM in Denver). While we tried to get accustomed to the time change we took a walk around the Tower Bridge area. I was pleased with the couple of photos I snagged and figured I'd put them on my new site. We stopped by a few landmarks: London Authority building, Tower Bridge, London Tower, [Gherkin building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_St_Mary_Axe), and plenty of wandering around in between. Go check out [Alex's photo gallery](http://alexking.org/blog/2011/08/16/london-afternoon), too.
