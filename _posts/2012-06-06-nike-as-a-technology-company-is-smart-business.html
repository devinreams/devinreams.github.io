started with Nike+ running
innovated with the shoe that tracks force of steps
integration with iPod, iPhone
came to Fuel Band tracking in a smarter way (than steps like Jawbone, Fitbit)
GPS running
confluence of Fuel (again, shoes with force)


Becomes a lifestyle
You particpate with your network of friends
Buy products to enable your activity

it's like Apple as a 'software' company that makes money selling hardware
it's the opposite (successful) of Facebook being a 'social' company that makes money selling products
technology first, products and money follow
