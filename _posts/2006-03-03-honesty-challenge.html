I'm required to write a paper this weekend. But first, I have to challenge myself to three days of nothing less than pure honesty. In other words, starting tomorrow morning everything I say and do will be 100% honest. There will be no lying, no exaggerating, no stealing, no cheating, no law breaking (speeding!), and so on. I can't imagine this being even remotely easy. Sarcasm is my weapon of choice!

I can't wait to share my experiences. Does anyone else out there think they could live up to this challenge?

...wait, why is being honest even considered a challenge?
