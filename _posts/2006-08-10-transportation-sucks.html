I'm pissed: "NO LIQUIDS OR GELS OF ANY KIND WILL BE PERMITTED IN CARRY-ON BAGGAGE. ITEMS MUST BE IN CHECKED BAGGAGE. This includes all beverages, shampoo, suntan lotion, creams, tooth paste, hair gel, and other items of similar consistency" (<a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/threat-change.shtm">Link</a>). I never check a bag, ever. I always put everything in the backpack and rolling luggage. There is no fucking way this is keeping us safer. Simple as that. The damned terrorists have won.
