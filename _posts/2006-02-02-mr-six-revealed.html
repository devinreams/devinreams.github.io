I worked at Six Flags this summer (Cash Control Supervisor) and I've come to love and hate the Venga Boys' song (We Like to Party). The individual who danced to that song on the commercials has been identified as one of the <em>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</em> guys, Danny Teeson. As usual I'll remain skeptical (as I've seen thousands of rumors online). Paul Davidson has 'the scoop' at <a href="http://www.pauldavidson.net/2006/02/01/mr-six-revealed/">Writing For My Enjoyment</a>.
