The &#8220;Holdays&#8221; (Christmas) are right around the corner and I always struggle to think up some things I absolutely &#8220;need.&#8221; Throughout the year situations will come up where you think to yourself &#8220;man, I wish I had one of those \___\_____ right now.&#8221; I do it all the time. Of course, I&#8217;ll forget each and every one of those situations when birthdays and Christmases approach. That won&#8217;t happen this time. For my own entertainment here are the five gifts I&#8217;d love to get.

## 1. Golf Lessons

It seems only natural that a business major spend some time on the golf course. Interestingly enough [my brother][1], the musician, has spent much more time golfing than I have. I figure I&#8217;m running low on expensive hobbies and this is one I&#8217;d enjoy taking up.

## 2. [CamelBak][2] hydration backpack

I&#8217;ve realized that I need to carry a few things when I go skiing (extra clothes, food, water) and there simply aren&#8217;t enough pockets in my jacket(s). Close, but not enough. So, a compact (black) &#8216;hydration pack&#8217; would make for an excellent accessory this winter. We wouldn&#8217;t want me to get dehydrated now, would we?
