Sick of getting credit offers that you never initiated? I get at least 3 credit-card offers each week. There's an easy way to stop these:
<div align="center"><strong>1-888-5OPTOUT or <a href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t">OptOutPrescreen.com</a></strong></div>
I wouldn't have noticed this offer was available to me if it weren't for <a href="http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/FTC-OptOutPrescreen.htm">this new regulation</a> requiring a statement in "12-point type - on the first page of the offer" letting me know I can stop unsolicited offers. You have the option of having your information removed for 5 years or permanently (you must mail back a form). If you're wary of giving up your information you can read <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/prescreen.htm">this page from the FTC</a>.

The FTC also points to <a href="http://www.dmaconsumers.org/offmailinglist.html">this website used for deleting yourself from direct marketing mailing lists</a>.

So... what are you waiting for?
