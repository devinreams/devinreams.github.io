On multitasking during a conference call:

<blockquote>Well, I sent the client the message. Then I had to send him another one, this time with the attachment I had forgotten to append. Finally, my third email to him explained why that attachment wasn’t what he was expecting. When I eventually refocused on the call, I realized I hadn’t heard a question the Chair of the Board had asked me.</blockquote>

I see this (and do it) on a daily basis. It's about time to consciously put <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2010/05/how-and-why-to-stop-multitaski.html">destructive multitasking</a> to an end.
