Most books I read are non-fiction and are related to technology, business, or life in general (much like this blog). The &#8220;[Sh*t My Dad Says][1]&#8221; book was a pleasantly-surprising story of Justin&#8217;s life with his irreverent and crass father. I was chuckling and laughing throughout the entire thing. It&#8217;s a quick read but if you&#8217;re looking for something light, I highly recommend it. It was the first book I read on the iPad using the iBooks app. Overall, I&#8217;m pretty pleased with the experience (but I still learn towards the Kindle as the better platform).
