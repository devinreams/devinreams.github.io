In case you haven&#8217;t seen what the U.S. Congress is working on lately (hint: not creating jobs, not fixing the economy) in between voting to make sure the [nation&#8217;s motto is still &#8220;In God We Trust&#8221;][1], please watch this video.

> PROTECT-IP is a bill that has been introduced in the Senate and the House and is moving quickly through Congress. It gives the government and corporations the ability to censor the net, in the name of protecting &#8220;creativity&#8221;. The law would let the government or corporations censor entire sites&#8211; they just have to convince a judge that the site is &#8220;dedicated to copyright infringement.&#8221;
