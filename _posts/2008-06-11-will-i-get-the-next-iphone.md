It&#8217;s a tricky question but the jerk we call Steve Jobs has made it so easy for me to say no:

1.  **Fixing stuff isn&#8217;t a feature:** I&#8217;m more than pissed about the recessed headphone jack. I had to go out and buy a $10 adapter because Steve said it was the best and only way&#8211;it had to be done to make sure the headphone jack survived. Whoops, second gen comes out and it&#8217;s back to normal?
2.  **AT&T isn&#8217;t worth the hassle:** These guys are using Steve as much as they can. Sure, they helped him bring it to the market but they&#8217;re milking this deal more than anything (upping the data plan rate?!). The lock-in is bad enough, but now taking away the activation via iTunes? It&#8217;s like saying &#8220;look how cool and flexible we are&#8211;whoa whoops, no we aren&#8217;t!&#8221;. Plus, I moved *away* from AT&T for a reason&#8230;
3.  **3G / GPS are silly:** I don&#8217;t need a super speed connection on my *phone*. I always have a computer near me&#8211;if I really need to sit down and look at some serious web pages then a) I can wait the extra few seconds, or b) I can go use a computer. GPS? The phone already does killer location via towers or wifi&#8211;too gimmicky!
4.  **The price:** I&#8217;m not going to spend a few hundred dollars every few years on a phone when my current one is already (paraphrasing Steve) &#8220;lightyears&#8221; ahead of the competition. I&#8217;m ahead of the curve (Blackberry pun?) and figure that my $200 will be worth over $3,000 dollars at retirement, haha.

But seriously, as great as the devices are it&#8217;s so hard to keep doing this to people. Steve is evil and people love him. Microsoft is trying so hard to be nice and people still hate it&#8230;.
