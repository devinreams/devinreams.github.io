<img align="right" id="image91" alt="valentine.png" src="https://devin.rea.ms/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/valentine.png" />Yes, Facebook is offering &#8216;[Facebook Valentines][1]&#8216;. Cute idea, but there are some problems. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Facebook and everything those [hard][2] [working][3] individuals produce&#8230; I guess they&#8217;ve spoiled me: I expect the absolute best.

First, the annoucement box is not pink! Sure the text is red but it really should stand out a bit more. Second, the picture shown to the right is obviously not zooming in on a Facebook Valentine. Lazy lazy&#8230; Third, I can&#8217;t wait to see the *&#8220;Hey Jon, your Mom isn&#8217;t on Facebook so would you mind telling her &#8216;thanks&#8217; for me?&#8221;* Valentine. Ehh, is it worth the $5? I wish Facebook would provide more statistics on Annoucements (number shown, number of impressions/clicks, etc). That&#8217;d be neat.
