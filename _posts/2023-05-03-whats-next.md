I'm suddenly faced with an existential question: what do I want to do?

1. Work with fellow technologists: 

2. Hands-on contributions: nerd and hacker

3. Collaborate on and communicate strategy: alignment is one of those words

4. Coach, mentor, lead others: directly or indirectly

5. Learn and grow with the organization: 


What kind of roles or areas do I start to steer towards?

- Product Development: where I've spent most
- Go To Market: pre-sales, customer success, customer-facing with clear business outcomes
- Consulting: come in and assess, help others realize a solution or reach a potential
