title: What's Next?!

I'm faced with an existential question: what do I want to do with my life? I've started to narrow some of my thinking down to my "work life" ... I'll try to figure out "life life" later. Here's my distillation of the kinds of things I'm looking for in my next role...

1. **Work with fellow technologists**: I've always loved computers, from "Kids Web Camp" in the 1990s to building websites for my middle and high schools. And the way I learned and enjoyed this most was with others: from Dad helping me buy parts and build my PC to sharing my own understanding of technical concepts with my wife (who knows far more than I do now).

2. **Hands-on contributions**: I've always thought of myself, as a nerd and hacker, not a computer scientist. I like to get my hands dirty enough to figure out a solution, make something work, and learn what's needed as I go. I want to keep up with technology by doing, not just learning.

3. **Collaborate on and communicate strategy**: "alignment" is one of those words you either cringe at or lean into. I've found some of the trickiest parts of work always relate to people: what are we doing, why are we doing it, who decided that, who gets to challenge it, can I get involved, etc. Setting a vision, involving and socializing with others, figuring out the details, and delegating decisions (or work) are the kinds of things I've enjoyed being a part of most recently.

4. **Coach, mentor, and lead others**: I've loved managing people and I enjoy learning and working with others from different disciplines and backgrounds. Either directly or indirectly I want to keep helping build and scale teams and help people do their best work.

5. **Learn and grow with the organization**: I haven't figured it all out and certainly don't know everything. I also recognize that roles (or their context in an organization) often change and I love the work needed to grow and adapt myself. I'm comfortable with ambiguity, scrappy enough to figure things out or seek those that can help me. I want to keep growing.


So what kind of roles or areas do I start to steer towards?

- Product and Software Development: where I've spent most time recently, perhaps through sheer momentum. It's fun to help a team build something.
- Go-To-Market: I look back fondly on my time in technology companies and helping with pre-sales, customer success, and any customer-facing work with clear business outcomes. It's challenging and rewarding work.
- Consulting: I've had a variety of experiences where I got to jump in and assess someone's needs then do some work to help them get where they want to be. I love helping others and also find it fun to collaborate and come up with a solution or reach some unmet potential.

I've been on a "senior management" trajectory for the past few years but bounced around a bit. My long-term goal is likely executive-level management starting at the "Director" level soon. My exposure and experience to the work have been fun and challenging and I think I'd continue to be good at it. 

This is how I see myself today and now, with a little more clarity, can begin my search for what's next...
