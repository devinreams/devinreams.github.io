[Yahoo&#8217;s incentives][1] to switch [suck][2] (for a few reasons). First, I don&#8217;t see a single thing that interests me. If Yahoo paid me, I&#8217;d gladly switch over and use it (exclusively). I doubt that will happen but hey, I love to complain/rave about anything and everything. Wait, here&#8217;s an idea: **make your stuff work better than the other guys**. How is it easier to spend money on consumers rather than the product? This old quote is [straight from the Yahoo Blog][3] &#8220;*This commitment to being the best should be crystal clear from our investments in talented people, [research][4], [innovation and new products][5]*&#8220;. Where do the incentives fit in that list of investments?
