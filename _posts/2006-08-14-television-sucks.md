I assure you not everything I publish is a rant. I&#8217;m just feeling feisty lately&#8230; my latest target is television. A [few][1] [peopl][2]e have described their experience with a month without TV and I&#8217;m following suit. My roommate and I had talked about dropping Comcast for months now because, frankly, that&#8217;s too much money to pay for a lot of crappy channels. In this day and age I should be able to pick and choose. Since nobody is offering the a-la-carte TV package we decided to opt out entirely. Besides, we&#8217;d rather waste away in front of the computer than the television&#8230;

But seriously, if we are to spend any time in front of a television we decided we&#8217;d rather be watching movies. After surfing [IMDB][3] one day I realized there are a ton of flicks out there that I just never got around to seeing. This is where [Blockbuster Online][4] comes in. I already threw 10 movies in our queue last night and I&#8217;m excited to start watching them (on our 52&#8243; TV with 7.1 surround sound. Yay home theatre).

But the thing is, there are a ton of movies out there and I have no idea what they&#8217;re about or if they&#8217;re any good. This is where you guys come in. If you have any suggestions on movies that I **must** see, then leave a comment and I promise you I will. [Joe][5] is first in line with [The Princess Bride][6]. In fact, if you haven&#8217;t noticed, I set up a ~~Movies page~~ to document my experiences (most recent on the home page). So, help me out&#8230; **What should I watch?**
