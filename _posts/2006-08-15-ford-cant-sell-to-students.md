I received a neat little letter from Ford in the mail today. As with all junk mail, I opened it. To my surprise I was invited to purchase an 06/07 vehicle from Ford and instant get $500 off! Wowzers, Ford, great idea! Let me go visit your cool website: [fordcollegehq.com][1]. Whoa, wait. What is this? There&#8217;s no way a student ever looked at this website before Ford sent out this letter&#8230; no self-respecting 18-35 year old would have spent more than three minutes on here. So, Ford, why didn&#8217;t you get someone&#8217;s expert opinion? That&#8217;s a rhetorical question becuase I&#8217;m here to give it to you anyway.

## Terrible Selection

The [&#8220;get a ride page&#8221;][3] is the biggest, most critical mistake Ford made. Why do you show us every possible car you sell? Do you have any idea what a college student is looking for in a car? For starters, it&#8217;s certainly not the [Crown Victoria][4], or [Freestar][5]. Why take the shotgun approach to marketing? If you&#8217;re going to make a site for college students, try thinking like a college student looking for a new car. This mistake should be self-evident. Try focusing on a couple of cars that have proven popular for students and then spend a little more time highlighting those.

The problem is you just provide us a list of every car you&#8217;ve made available and you assume we&#8217;ll take the time to research each one? I may have seen every one of these cars on a commercial but I wouldn&#8217;t know a [Freestar][5] from a [Freestyle][6]. Use some pictures for goodness sakes! Besides, students are very lazy. We need this information handed to us. We don&#8217;t have time to open up each product page and then crawl through it. That&#8217;s the point of making a fordcollegehq.com website. Pull the information we need together and make it straight forward. I&#8217;d use actual students and feature &#8220;the prep&#8221; or &#8220;the football player&#8221; or &#8220;the environmentalist&#8221; and then match them up with a car, how it fits them, which features are best, etc. Hello? The name of the campaign is &#8220;define yourself&#8221;.

Ford, that would&#8217;ve taken you a day or two to put together. Tops. Now look at you&#8230; you decided to be lazier than us.

## Terrible Website

First, just because you put music on the homepage doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll somehow grab the MTV/MySpace audience. Second, your website points me to so many different pages, why can&#8217;t I get the vital information on the front page? Again, this makes me work. Makes me click forward, click back, click a few pages deeper.

You even appear to give us students a little bit of &#8220;financing 101&#8243; when in reality you&#8217;re just pointing back to your credit website. This is not tailored to a student. This is a few pages of tons of words and another waste of time. Closed. Done. Bye, Ford.

## Rely on Marketing, Money, MTV?

So, you partner with MTV and assume they&#8217;re going to do all this work for you, right? That&#8217;s what it seems like. Throwing a MTV page on your website only detracts from the point: the cars. The page isn&#8217;t even put together very well and it&#8217;s hard to quickly determine what everything is. That&#8217;s just bad marketing. Draw my attention somewhere other than someone else&#8217;s website. Oh, and $500 on a $21,000 car? Goodness, that&#8217;s maybe a 2% discount after tax, title and all that. Student&#8217;s are used to radical deals. That&#8217;s the only thing we pay attention to. If I&#8217;m going to throw down that much money on a brand new car, you&#8217;d better offer some sort of incentive. Besides, I know your sales guys are going to treat me like some kid, so you&#8217;d better make the money worth the trouble&#8230;

But hey, that&#8217;s just my humble opinion..
