I found [this to be extremely interesting][1]: an article about <strike>stupid</strike> students protesting the anti-immigration legislation. Flying the flag upside down, ironically, demonstrates **distress**&#8230; not disrespect. As another reader pointed out, it&#8217;s also ironic that &#8220;&#8230;these young men and women are enjoying their educations on the back of the American taxpayer at a public school, while denigrating the country that provides these benefits to them.&#8221; I guess that&#8217;s fitting; our [public schools don&#8217;t teach][2] good sense. Sigh. One of my largest pet peeves has always been &#8220;people who make up for intelligence with volume.&#8221; Yell louder when that&#8217;s all you have going for you&#8230; Personally, I blame [the French][3].
