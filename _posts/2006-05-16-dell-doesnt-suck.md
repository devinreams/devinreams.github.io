&#8230;when they want to get your money. A few weeks ago I was mailed a coupon for $50 off any computer system over $800. Plus, I&#8217;d get free ground shipping. Dell saw me coming a mile away. I&#8217;m sure I was flagged &#8220;addcit&#8221; once I bought two LCDs and opened a Dell Preferred Credit account.

Rightfully so.

&#8230;I&#8217;ve always built my own computers. I think it was a mixture of having an abundance of free time and lack of abundance of cash. My &#8220;barebones&#8221; system was slowly upgraded over the years. I was running at a whopping 200mhz when I first started computing. Yikes. It was uber exciting when I upgrade my 4G drive to an 8G. It was so expensive too. I had no choice though: XP and Office took up like 3.5G alone. Oh the memories. I even remember installing my motherboard, looking at the processor, playing with Serial ATA cables. I hated putting in drives becuase of those cables. They were old and un-keyed so it took about 3 reboots to realize that something was upside down. Sigh.

I&#8217;m currently working on my second generation DIY machine. I&#8217;ve been pleased with it. I built it about 4 years ago after doing all kinds of research. So far I&#8217;ve had no issues with it&#8230; which is why I&#8217;m scared. I&#8217;m worried that these older drives will crash soon. If they don&#8217;t the PSU is going to go (it&#8217;s getting a bit noisey). Something is bound to happen and I don&#8217;t want to wait for that day.

I&#8217;m done building computers, though.

I used to know a decent amount about PC hardware. Lately I feel like I don&#8217;t know jack. I feel like I&#8217;m surrounded by a world of [Pauls][1] that could jump on NewEgg and build the best computer imaginable. I don&#8217;t think I know nearly enough of that stuff anymore. I didn&#8217;t even realize people were actually installing 1TB of RAID drives&#8230; in PCs!? I hadn&#8217;t even heard of a Pentium D, now I&#8217;m supposed to find out which motherboard to get for it? Ugh.

I&#8217;ll let Dell do it for me.

I played around online and made a bunch of configurations the other night. I ignored one minor detail: each time you hit submit order your coupon is rendered as &#8216;used&#8217;. I guess I forgot to tell Dell.com that I was just looking for the subtotal and tax. Jerks. My coupon was quickly labeled &#8216;invalid&#8217; though I hadn&#8217;t even bought anything. I had to call Dell.

The guy I talked to was friendly and clever enough to solve my problem. I walked him through my configuration and we arrived at my subtotal. He understood my situation and disappeared to talk to a supervisor. In the end I got a free video card upgrade and my free shipping. That&#8217;s in addition to the free 19&#8243; LCD upgrade. Overall I&#8217;m pleased with the experience.

&#8230;but that&#8217;s becuase they wanted my money. He made sure he &#8220;verified my needs&#8221; and made sure I was completely sure I didn&#8217;t need dual-DVD drives. No guys, I really know what I want, thanks for being so &#8220;helpful&#8221; though. I&#8217;m sure the post-sales experience won&#8217;t be the same. Oh well, I don&#8217;t plan on having to verify that anytime soon. I&#8217;m just excited to play with a new toy!

Oh, and if anyone is looking to buy a 19&#8243; LCD (Dell 1907) for a good price be sure to let me know. I figure two monitors is enough for me.
