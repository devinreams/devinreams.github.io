Last weekend we headed up towards Breckenridge to do some fishing with the fine folks at [Mountain Angler][1]. Our guide, Mark, did a great job getting us up to speed on fly fishing techniques and we were catching wild fish within a couple of hours.

By the end of the day, Rachel and I both caught at least a dozen fish between the two of us. It was a fun experience and something I can see doing again soon.
