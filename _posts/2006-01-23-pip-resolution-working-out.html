If you can't tell I love to be organized and lay everything out. I can be <em>very</em> spur of the moment (let me tell you about the time we went skiing at midnight until 2am, slept in my car, then drove to Vail the next morning...) but in general I like to know what the plan is.

I've been looking at my <a href="http://devinreams.com/schedule/">schedule</a> (I put it into Excel, colors and all, very fun!) and there's plenty of empty space. I realized if I don't put anything in there I will probably sit around, read blogs, poke around on Facebook, etc. I figured that theres plenty I could get done in this time if I just made a schedule...

<img width="64" height="96" align="right" id="image60" alt="workout.jpg" src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/workout.jpg" />So, I've added 'working out' to a few days each week. I had put this down as a New Year's resolution and I plan to keep this one (in addition to <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/01/21/pip-resolution-book-a-month/">reading a book a month</a>). The biggest step is making something a habit. Since I go to class every day I decided that once I get home I'll just go work out. I may have to scold myself ('No Devin! No email until you get back!') but I think scheduling the time should help.

I've actually signed up for <a href="http://www.cargomag.com/bootcamp/">CARGO's BootCamp</a> and found plenty of routines to get me through the weeks. I didn't even really know what pilates was until I saw this site. In any case, The 'camp' is free once you sign up and it has everything you need to get started. The hardest part is starting!

I think I'll start reading the 'food' section and see what I can do about my diet, too...
