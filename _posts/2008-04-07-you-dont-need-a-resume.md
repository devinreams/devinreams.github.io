&#8230;unless you&#8217;re looking for mediocrity. Because that&#8217;s what happens when we

1.  boil down our accomplishments into a one page memo, and
2.  convince ourselves we can make a good decision based on a one-page memo.

[<img src="http://strips.bitstrips.com/f05ae1a84572d70566b0580b7cec5de7.png" style="width:50%;height:50%;float:right" />][1]Seth Godin hires interns and notes a resume is &#8220;[an excuse to reject you][2].&#8221; If you&#8217;re truly exceptional you don&#8217;t need a resume. I wouldn&#8217;t consider myself exceptional but I can recall at least seven jobs (or projects) in the last year where a resume was never even mentioned. Here&#8217;s what you need:

*   **Relationships:** Knowing people can introduce you to some interesting opportunities. I tip my hat to [noah][3] who is probably responsible for half of the connections I&#8217;ve made outside of school. This is how I&#8217;ve done work for [pbWiki][4] and talked web design with [VentureBeat][5]. But, even in school, simply talking to students and professors allowed me to design a number of sites, TA for classes, and land an interview with a big firm&#8211;all without a resume.
*   **Accomplishments:** Yes, your resume can help summarize these for you&#8211;but let the work do the talking. If you&#8217;re a designer, make sure it&#8217;s easy to find these things. Heck, do some sample work for the company you really want to work for ([Kareem][6] got a sweet job at ESPN this way).
*   **Reputation:** If you do good work, and you are a great person (see the last two bullets) then your reputation will be as solid as a rock. Maintain it, cherish it, and make sure you control it. This will mean less work for you. In college, all it took was a recommendation and a reputation for quality to be offered a job without even soliciting it. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to have jobs handed to you?

Though, [Ben][7] makes the point that college graduates usually haven&#8217;t proven themselves and can&#8217;t look for these truly exceptional positions: *&#8220;Yet most college students are not all-stars and shouldn&#8217;t&#8230;just ignore all existing hiring conventions.&#8221;* Yes, if you&#8217;d like to work at a good-enough company. Again, I&#8217;ve had a few offers (some accepted, some not) without ever offering a resume. I know [Paul][8], while still in college, went to work for Yahoo! without one. Odds are he&#8217;ll never need one. His brand and website are far more valuable and a portfolio speaks much more than keywords on paper.

So, if you&#8217;re looking for those exceptional positions, start being an exceptional person and be an exceptional performer. Don&#8217;t use things like your formal education and a carefully edited resume as your only means to getting what you want.
