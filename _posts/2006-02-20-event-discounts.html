Why don't awesome events have student discounts? I can start rattling off a list of big events I would kill to go to this year (or last, or probably even next). But, they cost something like $300, $500 or even $1000-plus. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/jeremywright?m=41">Jeremy pointed out</a> <a href="http://www.blogonomics.net/">Blogonomics</a> today. It sounds like an <strong>awesome</strong> trip. Why don't the folks putting on big events start setting aside some student tickets? We'd love to participate, too... unfortunately some of us have to pay for a lot of schooling though. How about a send-Devin-to-Blogonomics fund? I'll sell my soul, I'll do anything!
