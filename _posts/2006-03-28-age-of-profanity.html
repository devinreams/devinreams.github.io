An <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060329/ap_on_re_us/age_of_profanity">AP article on profanity</a> made me wonder: are swear words becoming mainstream? I was thinking about this last night while watching some ABC Family. I thought to myself: "this is what ABC considered 'family' material?" I suppose the downward spiral is inevitable. Besides, they're just words right? Personally, I find it very hard to express myself on here sometimes becuase I choose not to use certain words. I think these colorful words have begun replacing thoughtful adjectives...
