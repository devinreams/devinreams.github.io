Just a few of the important lessons I&#8217;ve learned here in Austin.

1.  [Sleep is precious.][1]
2.  [Housekeeping doesn&#8217;t know that.][2]
3.  <strike>Dodgeball</strike>[Foursquare is fun to play.][3]
4.  Companies: Twitter is not the secret to success (nor the end-game); [you&#8217;re not Zappos][4].
5.  People really like BBQ in Texas.
6.  [Gary Vaynerchuk is still a badass.][5]
7.  But, other cyber celebrities like [Scoble][6] becomes less respectable (and relevant) each and every day.
8.  [John Gruber][7] talks the same way he writes: smartly (and hasn&#8217;t had to buy himself a drink in 7 years, his words).
9.  Companies: Despite the &#8220;convenience&#8221; of the internet, people still love picking up a phone and talking to a smart, capable human.
10. Nerd conferences are the only place you&#8217;ll see [lines for the men&#8217;s bathroom][8] but not the women&#8217;s.
