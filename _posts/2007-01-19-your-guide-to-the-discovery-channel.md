I love the [Discovery Channel][1]. Why? It&#8217;s the only &#8220;cable&#8221; channel we get in our &#8220;basic cable&#8221; package. Apparently that package means local programming + spanish channels + paid programming + Discovery Channel. Now that you understand why I&#8217;m a self-declared expert on the aforementioned channel, read on to learn more about the diverse programming found on Discovery&#8230;

Lets play a matching game! Try to match the description with the show:

1.  **Freezing, Wet Jobs** &#8211; Learn how hard it is to fish in the Bearing Sea (hint: you get cold and wet). 
2.  **Explosive Jobs** &#8211; Explore the excitement behind blowing something up four different ways every week.
3.  **Robber Jobs** &#8211; Learn how easy it is to break into people&#8217;s houses and what to do to secure your own.
4.  **Survival Jobs** &#8211; Understand how much it would suck if you were stranded, deserted, or lost just about anywhere but downtown.
5.  **Dirty Jobs** &#8211; Learn about the occupations you intentionally try not to learn about.
6.  **Psuedo-Science Jobs** &#8211; See how science can look cool while learning absolutely nothing.
7.  **Medical Jobs** &#8211; A first-hand look at how gross it is to operate on people.
8.  **Painful Jobs** &#8211; Get your adrenaline up watching other people bike, ski, and fall from places you&#8217;d never visit.
9.  **Construction Jobs** &#8211; Learn how just about every complicated structure in the world is made and how it never goes right.
10. **Jobs** &#8211; If a job hasn&#8217;t been explored in the above shows its explained here. Actually, there&#8217;s lots of overlap.

*   A. Extreme Engineering
*   B. It Takes A Thief
*   C. Man vs Wild
*   D. MythBusters
*   E. Dirty Jobs
*   F. FutureWeapons
*   G. Surgery Saved My Life
*   H. Deadliest Catch
*   I. How It&#8217;s Made
*   J. Stunt Junkies

There you have it. Every show on Discovery can be referred to as \_____ Jobs. Did you figure out my clever game? Here are the answers (highlight to see them): <u>[ <font color="#ffffff">H, F, B, C, E, D, G, J, A, I</font>]</u>
