We had a great time up in the Glenwood Springs, Colorado area last weekend as we did some camping and hiking with friends.

We drove up Friday evening from Denver, over Vail pass, into Glenwood Springs and then up towards the Aspen area. Turning towards Carbondale and then dropping out of cellular range, we were soon in Redstone, CO. The Redstone Campground was down by the river, quiet, and had nice facilities for camping.

Saturday morning we woke early (6 AM) and drove 45 minutes back past Glenwood to the Hanging Lake hike. It&#8217;s about 1.5 miles up through some steep switchbacks and rocky trail. But the lake is very much worth it (and a fascinating geological story). If you head up past the lake you can also see &#8216;spouting rock&#8217; which has at least 1 (we saw 4) point where water comes out of the other half of the lake high up above.

I still smell like campfire but was happy to get back out to the mountains. Last season was terribly dry and fire bans were in effect so we didn&#8217;t do any camping. We&#8217;ll hopefully be up a few more times this summer.

Thanks Nicole and John for planning a fun weekend!
