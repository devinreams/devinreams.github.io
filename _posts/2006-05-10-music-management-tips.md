With over 10,000 songs in my iTunes Library (all legally acquired, I swear) I constantly find myself &#8216;discovering&#8217; music. But, I&#8217;ve also realized there are a ton of albums I never listen to and would never want to in the future. Thus, the following are some of my methods to organizing the madness:

*   **Get the tags right:** First, I downloaded an automatic tagging program that correctly identified about 90% of my songs. Unfortunately some live albumns (bootlegs) weren&#8217;t found so those had to be manually mass-edited. I also found a bunch of poorly named artists. For example, blink-182 vs Blink-182 vs blink182, etc. Then there&#8217;s the pleasure of finding &#8216;The Ying Yang Twins&#8217;, &#8216;Ying Yang Twins&#8217;, &#8216;Ying Yang Twins Feat. \___\___&#8217; etc. In any case, let the software get the majority of the stuff cleaned up. There are a bunch of programs out there; some free, some not.
*   **Find the dupes: **From here I realized that I had literally hundreds of duplicates. Unfortunately iTunes has no way to easily remove them and I haven&#8217;t found any software that I can trust. So, when I feel ambitious I go through and Ctrl-Select a bunch that I know are simply duplicates. To this day I still have 1738 songs (thats over 4 days of music) that can be removed. Be careful, &#8216;Zak and Sara&#8217; on &#8216;Rockin&#8217; the Suburbs&#8217; is not the same as the one on &#8216;Ben Folds Live&#8217;. Thus, I don&#8217;t trust the software to do this part.
*   **Smart people use smart playlists:** Dragging and dropping stuff into playlists is time consuming. Sure, its fun for making party mixes, but I&#8217;m usually looking for certain types of music (depening on the mood). Thus, make smart playlists like &#8220;&#8216;Genre is &#8216;Rap&#8217; or Artist is &#8216;Ying Yang Twins&#8217; or Artist is &#8230; and Rating is greater than 3.&#8221; This is great becuase it&#8217;ll automatically add new music when I add it to my Library. I also have &#8216;My Top Rated&#8217; (greater than 3), &#8216;Four Stars&#8217;, &#8216;Five Stars&#8217;, and my favorite: &#8216;New Hotness&#8217;. All 4 and 5 star songs that haven&#8217;t been listened to 6 times is in this list. I still have over 300 songs that I&#8217;ve only listened to a few times (but are freaking awesome). Smart Playlists are extremely powerful.
*   **Shuffle your library and start rating: **In order to understand how much of my music should be deleted I simply play my Library on Shuffle and rate every song that plays. It helps having a second monitor becuase I can always have iTunes focused. After some time has passed I go back to the albums containing the 1 or 2 star songs and see if there&#8217;s anything in that album worth keeping. If not, purge away!
*   **Rate songs as soon as you add them:** I&#8217;m in the habit of listening to every song as soon as I add it to my Library (to prevent future build-up). This way I know (based on ratings) whether or not the music should even stick around for more than a few days. Plus, rating it as soon as I add it automatically pushes it to &#8220;New Hotness&#8221;, my playlist of choice.

Is there anything out there that you guys have done that works especially well? I&#8217;m all about trying new &#8220;systems&#8221; and I definitely need to get this monster collection under control.
