Over on <a href="http://business.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2006/01/04/itunes-feature-request/">BusinessBits</a> I asked why we don?t see enough ?desktop web apps? (or is it web desktop apps?) out there these days? Well? <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/feature/geek-to-live-web-search-desktop-launcher-148302.php">Lifehacker has posted a very useful one</a>. It puts input boxes on your desktop and you can press Alt-W to search Wikipedia, Alt-G, Google, etc. This is exactly the useful stuff I?m looking for! Anyone know of other cool things like this?
