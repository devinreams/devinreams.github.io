As [expected][1], Newsstand did not &#8220;go live&#8221; until late last night when dozens of Newsstand-enabled iOS app updates were made available in the App Store. The functionality is perfect: the apps that have &#8216;opted in&#8217; now appear in a custom Newsstand folder with the icon matching the cover of the periodical (if the developer so chooses). If you allow the push notifications for a new issue to arrive, the update is downloaded and the icon updates immediately. You can see both my WIRED and National Geographic magazines have updated in the screenshots above.
