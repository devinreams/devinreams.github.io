I&#8217;ve always been a big advocate of outsourcing through the use of virtual assistants. In fact, I wrote about [personal assistants][1] back in March and had started using a service called GetFriday. I had some mixed experiences (like sending a birthday greeting when it [wasn&#8217;t someone&#8217;s birthday][2]) and decided the cost was no longer justified.

## [TimeSvr][3] exceeds my expectations

Out of the blue, as I was thinking I needed to drop my assistant, I received an e-mail from the CEO of [TimeSvr][3]. He and I exchanged e-mails a bit. Let me pause and note: I was getting e-mail responses from the CEO faster than my assistant at GetFriday. I decided I needed to give TimeSvr a test run and I&#8217;m so glad I did.

Now this post isn&#8217;t meant to put down any other services (including the one popularized by [Tim Ferriss][4]), it&#8217;s to demonstrate how my expectations were far exceeded within my first day of use:

*   **Web-based task tracking:** with other services, you send an e-mail to your assistant and wait for a confirmation. TimeSvr provides you with a dashboard that shows all your tasks with and responses, updates, etc.
*   **Timeliness of responses:** the service has remained small to provide for better quality. Many of the other virtual assistant services have grown far larger than they could handle. I&#8217;ve found TimeSvr will get back to me in as little as an hour as opposed to a day.
*   **Excellent English skills:** it was very obvious to me that the assistants excel at the language. Some of my more enjoyable e-mails had been from previous assistants in broken English. I can actually talk to my assistant on the phone now, I couldn&#8217;t easily do that before.
*   **Effectiveness exceeds expectations:** every time I get a response from an assigned task I always think &#8220;wow, s/he&#8217;s good!&#8221;. I had to find a replacement kitchen accessory: my assistant placed calls to numerous retailers to find the part, the manufacturer, provided me with the warranty details, etc. I was floored with the level of detail I was handed.

I love assigning a task and getting a call back in an hour or two with my assistant and a customer service representative on the line. &#8220;Hello Devin, this is \___\_\\_\_, I have \_\_\____ on the line with me and they&#8217;d like to confirm \___\___\_\\_\_. Okay, thank you, Devin.&#8221; Wow. I didn&#8217;t even realize you could get someone on the phone from \_\_\___\_____.

The best part of TimeSvr is the fact they probably don&#8217;t put themselves in the same category of services that I&#8217;ve used in the past (which were touted as the best, at the time):

## TimeSvr features

This is a company that &#8220;gets it&#8221;. They understand the web worker like myself, especially. You have various mediums to submit a task, no matter where you are or what you&#8217;re doing.

[<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/3117706069_0a6142205d.jpg" width="500" height="118" alt="TimeSvr dashboard" />][5]

*   **E-mail:** Sending tasks to the tasks e-mail will automatically get routed and assigned immediately. You can see these tasks appear in your dashboard.
*   **Skype**: Chat with the Skype account to submit a task. If you&#8217;re on instant messenger all day, why not?
*   **Phone**: If you&#8217;re on the road and need to cancel an appointment just pick up the phone and let them know.

And here&#8217;s one of the best features, if you&#8217;re a trusting person: complete your profile. Simply fill out your contact details, calendar credentials, authorized credit card number, shipping address, travel preferences, etc. Once you&#8217;ve provided all your details, the possibilities for easily assigning tasks open up.

If you don&#8217;t want to provide everything up front, then simply include it in the task. I&#8217;ve had insurance payments made, online subscriptions canceled. I even &#8220;lost&#8221; a gift certificate applied to my Amazon account. Within minutes my assistant found which item the certificate was applied to. I thought it had just expired&#8230; oops.

## Try it for yourself

TimeSvr is far more affordable than any comparable service I&#8217;ve found out there. At $69 per month you receive unlimited basic tasks (book a flight, cancel this appointment) and up to 8 hours of extended (or complex) task time. The team is available 24/7 including holidays which exceeds most other service I&#8217;ve looked into.

I can&#8217;t recommend these guys enough. Go ahead and [sign up today][3]. You can try them out for three days, free.

## My assistant wrote this post

Just joking. But I did ask them (in the form of a task) what *they* thought were the three best things about the service. They were &#8220;saving precious time&#8221;, &#8220;really cost effective solutions&#8221;, and &#8220;privacy control&#8221; (with explanations for each). I was impressed and agree. Sorry to disappoint but I really haven&#8217;t found anything negative to say about this group.
