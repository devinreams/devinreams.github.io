We got back from a long vacation to Kenya for a safari. The trip was December 19th - January 9th. I had an awesome time and I now have 1,800+ pictures to go sort through. Plus another 40-50 minutes of HD video to edit, post online, etc.

But the scary part was coming back home and having flu-like symptoms. I figured "well I never get sick, what can this be" so I checked with the doctor. He did a flu test and the results came back negative. What's left? Some random bug or malaria.

It wasn't malaria.

But that would've been a pretty sweet story, eh?

Check out some of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/sets/72157612395785512/">safari highlights</a> on Flickr and I'll add the rest as I get some time.
