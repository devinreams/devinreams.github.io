If I can find just one person who understands [these codes][1] that&#8217;d make my <strike>day</strike> year. I don&#8217;t know why but I&#8217;d get a certain amount of pleasure using server response codes to converse. Someday, I can imagine this moving into everyday conversation, just like &#8216;lol&#8217; and &#8216;omg&#8217; I can tell that girl that her dress is 406.
