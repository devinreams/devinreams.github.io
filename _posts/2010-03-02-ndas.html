Like Alex, I've had a <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2010/03/01/ndas">post on NDAs</a> ready to draft up any day now. But many people have said it better than I could: NDAs are, in most cases, unnecessary; as if I had the time or energy to implement your idea, assuming it's even a good one. As with <a href="http://devin.reams.me/how-to-create-a-web-design-proposal/">RFPs</a>, NDAs are often a good litmus test: some of the best projects and ideas come without one.
