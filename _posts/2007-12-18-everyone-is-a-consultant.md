Penelope Trunk is predicting it: [the end of consulting][1]. I agree. I call myself a &#8216;consultant&#8217; but I realized that all the work I&#8217;ve done in the last few years has been, in essence, &#8220;consulting.&#8221;

I&#8217;m not surprised, either. It&#8217;s easier than ever to become an expert ([Wikipedia][2], right?) and it&#8217;s especially easy to work from home ([Web Worker Daily][3] rocks!). In fact, I intend to work from home or a number of remote client locations for the next few weeks. Heck, I work for a Big Four and I use Toggl to track my time across clients, projects and many other things.

That&#8217;s what I love about where I work. There&#8217;s a desire to be entrepreneurial, a leader in innovation. Our partner realizes we need to adapt and I strongly believe we&#8217;re all consulting for a variety of people (clients, colleagues, etc.). And once everyone is consulting, no one is consulting.
