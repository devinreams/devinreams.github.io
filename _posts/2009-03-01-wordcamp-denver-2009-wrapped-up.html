There will be a few weeks of little things here and there, but, yes, it's over. The first WordPress conference in Denver has come and gone and I survived. Thanks to <a href="http://alexking.org/">Alex</a> and <a href="http://kizzknows.com/">Rachel</a> for their help running the conference and doing the legwork I couldn't get to. A big thanks to the volunteers who showed up early to help out: Mike, Mike, and Kristal. Finally, a big thanks to the speakers who came to speak.

So far, the feedback coming in is great. As always, you can't please everybody all the time. Plus, shit happens; it's to be expected. I don't think we would've done too much differently, though. There are always trade-offs and I think we did the best we could given the circumstances.

Denver has attracted a ton of talent and interesting individuals and I hope <a href="http://denver.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a> was a good event for them. I'll post some thoughts and experiences over at <a href="http://mindaverse.com/">Mind Averse</a> when I get a few minutes.
