Nordstrom got it right tonight when I brought in a pair of pants to be altered. I had bought the pair across the street at Nordstrom Rack and the guy told me they usually charge for the alteration. No worries! But, once the measurements were taken he said &#8216;hey, no charge&#8217;. So, I walked from Men&#8217;s Clothing to Men&#8217;s shoes and spent a few bucks.
