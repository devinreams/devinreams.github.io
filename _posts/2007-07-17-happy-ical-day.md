[Happy iCal Day!][1] If you use a Mac and have iCal in the tray you&#8217;ll notice the icon always shows July 17th. Well, for once it&#8217;s right! I find this especially humorous because I&#8217;ve started using my Mac as my primary computer (I&#8217;m going to be out of town for 3 weeks, I need to carry my life in my backpack).
