I nearly forgot I had written about my secrets to exam success: [Studying for Tests][1]. If you initially doubted me, that&#8217;s fine, I would be hesitant too. Let me assure you I received very high A&#8217;s on both accounting tests the second time around. As mentioned, take the first test and set the pace for the rest of the semester&#8230; do yourself a favor and focus on all those other important things during your extra time. That&#8217;s what I do!
