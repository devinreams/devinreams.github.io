First, welcome to my new readers. I noticed a [substantial spike in my traffic][1] yesterday when the latest 9rules members were [announced][2]. Thanks to everyone who emailed, messaged, and left their congratulations- I do appreciate it.

On to business: you basically have two weeks left to get your holiday shopping done. If you&#8217;re like me you&#8217;re probably one of many things: a) lazy b) scared of large crowds of determined women or c) uncreative. Luckily the internet is here to remedy each of my shortcomings. Since I shop for nearly everything online these days: clothes, toys and yes, even [food][7] why not others&#8217; gifts? I searched for some simple gift finding tools online and here is what I&#8217;ve found.

A lot of people in my life enjoy **gadgets** and toys nearly as much as I do. Best Buy has built a decent site that helps provide gift ideas for those who need something **electronic** this season. I didn&#8217;t find this site as useful as I was originally led to believe. There are a ton of questions which lead to pretty **self-evident** gifts (Does this person have a desktop computer?). But, if you&#8217;re looking to shop for a nerd and have no idea where to start, this is certainly your place.

</h2>

I can&#8217;t think of anything I can&#8217;t buy at Target (or Wal-Mart) and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve found this tool to be the **most useful**. You don&#8217;t have to enter a lot of information and answer a lot of questions to get a **big list of neat ideas**. Personally, the time I spent browsing sparked some ideas of my own.

</h2>

Here&#8217;s a site that&#8217;ll provide you with an eclectic mixture of gift ideas. If you need **something unique** that most people wouldn&#8217;t think about getting then Overstock is a great choice. Like Target, a few categories and the tool with provide you with a well-categorized list of gifts for just about everyone you can think of. Not to mention, you&#8217;ll probably end up **saving a lot of money** buying it here rather than anywhere else.

Here&#8217;s a site that provides maybe the **largest compilation** of gifts and lists. You fill out a simple questionnaire and are presented with a plethora of gifts from a ton of online stores. The gifts are **diverse** and I&#8217;ve found gifts for girlfriends that ranged from something fun ($5.00) to a dozen gold roses ($499.99). If you&#8217;re really in the dark about where to even begin **I&#8217;d suggest spending some time here**.

**Hopefully those of us that always struggle will have a little more success this season thanks to these sites. If you have any others you&#8217;ve found useful be sure to share them in the comments.**
