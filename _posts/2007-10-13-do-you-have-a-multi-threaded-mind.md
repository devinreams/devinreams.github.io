As I sit here and write this I&#8217;m also listening to music and following along with it. I&#8217;m sure we all do it, this is no amazing feat. To some people the additional input forces you to focus. For others, it&#8217;s distracting. For me, I feel like I can pay attention to what I&#8217;m doing *and* the music simultaneously.

Perhaps this comes with growing up in the multi-tasking generation. But I find myself able to do a few things at the same time and remain focused. For example, I can be singing a song stuck in my head while thinking about the spreadsheet in front of me. If I&#8217;m working on something and need to remember a number I can repeat it in my head while still thinking about the task at-hand.

Is this weird? Is this others feel like they have or can do? I wonder if I have some sort of [multi-threaded mind][1]. I&#8217;m obviously not doing two immediate things at the same instance, but to me two things happening very quickly can be indistinguishable.

*Update:* A few minutes of more searching and [it appears this is how our brains are built][2]. I always knew I could walk and chew gum but can you personally hold two thoughts at the same time in your mind?
