I&#8217;m a firm believer that college is only half (if even that) of one&#8217;s education. For example, my new job has taught me more about (Access) databases in one day then I&#8217;ve learned all semester in class (no offense). Plus, I can tell you more about the telcom industry than you&#8217;d ever care to know. Welcome to day two.

In school you typically learn at an &#8216;average&#8217; pace and classes try to cater to everyone. Hence the bell curve. Sure, classes can be challenging but when you make mistakes you merely get a few points off. In the business world you&#8217;re not always handed a textbook or a study guide.. you figure it out. Very, very quickly.

With that said, mistakes become costly. So, keep in mind, **there are worse things in the world than getting a problem wrong on a test**. In the grand scheme of things, that mistake was a very cheap learning experience.

This leads me to my next point: I&#8217;d say that &#8216;picking up stuff quickly&#8217; is one of my most valuable traits. Not everything in life is technical and being 100% book smart is not something to strive for. No, I strongly subscribe to the &#8216;you dont have to be smart, you have to be clever&#8217; philosophy. Unfortunately, if you can&#8217;t do that, **if you can&#8217;t quickly absorb new skills and acquire new knowledge you need to compensate somewhere else.**

My thought is that you start out with 100 points to assign to different characteristics. For me I&#8217;d say my breakdown is as follows:

*   50 points go to &#8216;cleverness&#8217; (picking stuff up quickly, understanding overall concepts, doing well on tests),
*   20 for &#8216;leadership&#8217; (management, ability to relate and understand different people),
*   10 points to &#8216;helpfulness&#8217; (willingness, capability, patience),
*   10 points of &#8216;creativity&#8217;,
*   5 points to &#8216;friendliness&#8217; (outgoing, cheerful, funny, caring), and
*   5 points of arrogance and egoism (being an ass, not listening to others)

I&#8217;d like to shuffle my points around a bit. In fact I&#8217;d love to reassign my arrogance points to friendliness&#8230; but if I did that I&#8217;d sacrifice a level of confidence. And if I lacked cleverness I&#8217;d probably need to be a bit more friendly and creative.

As time goes on, though, your point pool increases&#8230; hopefully. **You don&#8217;t just resize the slices of pie, you end up working with a bigger pie!** I&#8217;m constantly trying to add points to certain areas while learning how to avoid sacrifices in others. You don&#8217;t necessairly pick this up in college.. for many it eventually happens. But, take the student who spends more time practicing sports than in class, or the guy who can&#8217;t balance a girlfriend and studying. High school and college are good for teaching people how to shuffle points. This is great because you learn where you want to focus your enegergies: you find what few things you&#8217;re best at and passionate about.

But, as you grow, you want to better yourself in all your strongest areas. You want to take those few things you&#8217;re the *best* at and continue to improve them. This is Jim Collins&#8217; hedgehog concept and I&#8217;ll be writing about my personal &#8216;hedgehog&#8217; in the next week or so.

Interestingly, I&#8217;ve done most of my betterment outside of class&#8230; maybe that&#8217;s just me, though? How does your pie look? Are you simply shuffling the slices or are you striving to increase your overall size? Do you have a ton of little pieces? Are you focusing on the right areas?
