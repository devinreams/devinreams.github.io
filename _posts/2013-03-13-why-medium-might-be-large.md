[Chris Brogan, on Ev William&#8217;s Medium][1]:

> I’ve written five posts, all of them in a different collection &#8230; I’ve written about what mantras and chanting have done to improve my business. I’ve written about Microsoft Windows 8 and how it’s a disruptor. I’ve written about my mostly plant-based eating choices. All over the map. If I wrote this way on this blog, it’d be hard to know whether to subscribe or not. (Yes, I write somewhat varied material here, but there’s still a general theme.) That, to me, is the magic button of Medium.

I disagree. Lots of services already aggregate long-form discussions around a common taxonomy (Tumblr being of note).

Plus, this is something Chris Yeh first talked about back in 2007: [The Grand Unified Theorem of Blogging][2] — I piggy-backed on it with my own post titled [Blogging Audiences and Feedback][3]

In short: the more you talk about, the less focused you are, the less readership your site will enjoy. In other words, if you don’t write for a niche you won’t be “successful.”

As Yeh followed up in the comments: &#8220;Success means different things to different people. Like you, I’m content to write about the things that interest me, and to let the chips fall as they may.&#8221;

While Medium certainly reminds me of the blog networks and webrings of the early years, I&#8217;m confident they&#8217;re also aware of the reasons we no longer see webrings and blog networks. &#8220;Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&#8221;
