Quick! <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/beta/getthebeta.mspx">Go download the Office 2007 beta</a>. You can test every Office product. Personally, I'm just downloading Office Professional Plus and Visio for work. Naturally I'll try everything (especially OneNote) at home tonight. So far it has a user-friendly application called 'SmartSource' which gives you everything you need to know (including the product key). I haven't had time to test much lately (I expect Vista Beta 2 in the mail soon). Anyway, why are you reading this? Go download. (<a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=1334">Source</a>)
