Whoops, it&#8217;s already been another week. Here I am to revisit all the excitement that went on last week. With school starting there&#8217;s obviously tons of great stuff to talk about&#8230;

<!--more-->

## School

I&#8217;m only taking four classes this semester (only needed three to graduate, ha!) and it&#8217;s going to be nice having a lighter load this last semester of college.

#### Ethics and Technology

Should prove to be an interesting class. The class will end up co-authoring a published book in groups of two or three people per article. I like to write, I&#8217;m pretty versed in philosophy and technology &#8212; this class shouldn&#8217;t be an issue.

#### Business Intelligence

This class is dedicated to data, how it&#8217;s acquired, organized, distributed, etc. Basically we&#8217;ll learn about databases (already quite proficient) and then do some data mining projects. I&#8217;m so excited I fell asleep in this class (of 14) on the first day. Oops.

#### School and Society

This is a class in the education school. Little known fact: not very many guys in education. I&#8217;m quite certain there is a 23:6 girl to guy ratio in this class. Again, here&#8217;s a somewhat philosophical class about school. There will be reading, a few projects, debating. No worries.

#### Auditing and Assurance

Oh yeah, I guess I&#8217;m an accounting major. This class is basically what I&#8217;ll be doing starting in the fall. Working for a Big Four firm working on Technology Services and Risk Solutions. This is a different kind of accounting class. There aren&#8217;t many number problems. It&#8217;s more about methods and things of that nature. This has potential to be challenging.

## That&#8217;s it&#8230;

For the most part last week was just getting back into the swing of things. Getting schedules organized, books purchased, and so on. Until next week&#8230;
