We know what [John Moore is reading][1] and what&#8217;s on [Kathy Sierra&#8217;s (virtual) coffee table][2]. I decided I&#8217;d take a look and see what I&#8217;ve been reading.

> One of the best ways to get to know someone is to look at their bookshelf. Or at least their coffee table.

I couldn&#8217;t agree more. I remember someone walking into our house one day and the magazines on the coffee table gave an insightful look at who I was and what I was into. They mentioned how great the magazines were and he and I quickly found some common ground (The magazines were Fortune, Cargo, PC Magazine, and FastCompany). I no longer have magazines on my coffee table but I certainly have a growing pile of books lying around. These are the books I&#8217;m in the process of reading:

</p>

&#8230;and these are the books on my shelf. Most have been read while a few will sit there until I feel it&#8217;s appropriate to read them.

I wish I had more time to read becuase I have a lot more [books piling up in queue][3]. My goal is to finish a book a month and so far im 0/2. I think it&#8217;s best I get back on track&#8230;

What&#8217;s on your bookshelf? Is it a pretty accurate portrayal of who you are and your interests? Mine certainly are. I love business, marketing, blogs, history, and technology. What about you?
