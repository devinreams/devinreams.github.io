	First, welcome to my new readers. I noticed a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/316942775/">substantial spike in my traffic</a> yesterday when the latest 9rules members were <a href="http://9rules.com/blog/2006/12/new-additions-12-07-06/">announced</a>. Thanks to everyone who emailed, messaged, and left their congratulations- I do appreciate it. If you are new or haven't browsed my site before be sure to check out my <a href="http://devinreams.com/archives/">Archives</a> and <a href="http://devinreams.com/articles/">Articles</a> to see what I've written in the last year. I've also built some useful <a href="http://devinreams.com/tools/">Tools</a> and pulled together some <a href="http://devinreams.com/quotes/">Quotes</a> worth checking out. Welcome!

	On to business: you basically have two weeks left to get your holiday shopping done. If you're like me you're probably one of many things: a) lazy b) scared of large crowds of determined women or c) uncreative. Luckily the internet is here to remedy each of my shortcomings. Since I shop for nearly everything online these days: clothes, toys and yes, even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/grocery-breakfast-foods-snacks-organic/b?ie=UTF8&node=16310101">food</a> why not others' gifts? I searched for some simple gift finding tools online and here is what I've found.

	<h2 style="padding-top:10px"><a href="http://www.wowfactorfinder.com/">Best Buy WOW Factor Finder</a></h2>
	A lot of people in my life enjoy <strong>gadgets</strong> and toys nearly as much as I do. Best Buy has built a decent site that helps provide gift ideas for those who need something <strong>electronic</strong> this season. I didn't find this site as useful as I was originally led to believe. There are a ton of questions which lead to pretty <strong>self-evident</strong> gifts (Does this person have a desktop computer?). But, if you're looking to shop for a nerd and have no idea where to start, this is certainly your place.

	<h2 style="padding-top:10px"><a href="http://www.target.com/gp/browse.html?ie=UTF8&node=3112881">Target Gift Finder</a></h2>
	I can't think of anything I can't buy at Target (or Wal-Mart) and that's why I've found this tool to be the <strong>most useful</strong>. You don't have to enter a lot of information and answer a lot of questions to get a <strong>big list of neat ideas</strong>. Personally, the time I spent browsing sparked some ideas of my own.

	<h2 style="padding-top:10px"><a href="http://www.overstock.com/giftfinder">Overstock.com Gift Finder</a></h2>
	Here's a site that'll provide you with an eclectic mixture of gift ideas. If you need <strong>something unique</strong> that most people wouldn't think about getting then Overstock is a great choice. Like Target, a few categories and the tool with provide you with a well-categorized list of gifts for just about everyone you can think of. Not to mention, you'll probably end up <strong>saving a lot of money</strong> buying it here rather than anywhere else.

	<h2 style="padding-top:10px"><a href="http://www.findgift.com/Services/Gift-Finder/">Gift Finder</a></h2>
	Here's a site that provides maybe the <strong>largest compilation</strong> of gifts and lists. You fill out a simple questionnaire and are presented with a plethora of gifts from a ton of online stores. The gifts are <strong>diverse</strong> and I've found gifts for girlfriends that ranged from something fun ($5.00) to a dozen gold roses ($499.99). If you're really in the dark about where to even begin <strong>I'd suggest spending some time here</strong>.

	<strong>Hopefully those of us that always struggle will have a little more success this season thanks to these sites. If you have any others you've found useful be sure to share them in the comments.</strong>
