Did you know you can help recruiters? You typically think of them as someone <em>you</em> need to know and <em>you</em> require in order to get a job. But what if you already have a job and aren't looking to move? What if you have a network of upcoming or recent college graduates? Well, in that case you can do someone a favor! Why wouldn't you?
