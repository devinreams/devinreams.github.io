I remember reading about <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/can-you-crack-code.html">Google's Da Vinci Code Quest</a>. It's a pretty good puzzle today (1 of 24 complete!) and I think it's helped me with my Soduku skills... or vice versa. In any case, someone needs to make sure I don't forget this every day.
