Here again are some of the cool things I&#8217;ve found, done, or learned this past week:

**Monday**  
For you iPhone users, **[MobileScrobbler][1]** will scrobble (send data to last.fm) straight from your jailbroken iPhone. A bunch of other features include: lyrics, playlists and recommended tracks.

**Tuesday**  
I&#8217;m a huge proponent of telecommuting. I hate spending a half-hour getting ready in the morning, shining my shoes, packing a lunch and then driving / riding the train maybe an hour each morning. That&#8217;s 2 &#8211; 3 hours each day I could just as easily work from home! [**Sun did a study on how much a day or two each week could save in energy.**][2]

**Wednesday**  
I&#8217;ve started making fruit smoothies in the morning which is probably the best thing to happen to my routine ([I wrote about how important morning routines are][3]). It&#8217;s as easy as buying some bananas, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries&#8211;then mixing it (in [The Magic Bullet ][4]of course). Heck, make a pitcher&#8217;s worth for the whole week. Thank me later.

**Thursday**  
My Man in India (my [virtual assistant from GetFriday][5]) has done some fun tasks for me lately. For a few weeks I had him go into Facebook on Friday, see who had a birthday in the past week, and then send them a message. I love to send people these messages &#8212; just to say hi &#8212; but I figured it was a simple enough task to outsource. It went well, I had a few conversations with long lost friends. But! [Noah Kagan][6] was wished a happy birthday&#8230; a few months early.

**Friday**  
**Watch out for Linkedin address book imports.** I accidentally (or was it meant to be?) invited my entire contact list to connect. But, again, I re-connected with some long lost friends (including an ex- from two years ago). I should get an award for most people &#8216;recruited&#8217; to the darn site, though (at least 5 sign ups a day for a few days in a row).

Haha, that&#8217;s all for this week&#8230; I&#8217;m off to Colombia by the time you read this. See you if / when I get back!
