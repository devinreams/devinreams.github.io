Speaking of dressing like a grown up, \[Ramit\](http://iwillteachyoutoberich.com) introduced me to a helpful service called Trunk Club. In short, you pick out outfits on their site that match your style, chat with your own consultant about the clothes you want, and then in a few days you receive a big box full of great (high end) clothing. If you like it all, keep it. If you don&#8217;t, put those pieces in the box and send it back. If you&#8217;ve looked at catalogs and said &#8220;well, I like that look&#8221; but then arrived at a store only to fail at picking out outfits, this is a no brainer. Ramit summed it up best: &#8220;It saves me HOURS of time and gets terrific results&#8221;.
