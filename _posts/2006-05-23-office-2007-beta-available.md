Quick! [Go download the Office 2007 beta][1]. You can test every Office product. Personally, I&#8217;m just downloading Office Professional Plus and Visio for work. Naturally I&#8217;ll try everything (especially OneNote) at home tonight. So far it has a user-friendly application called &#8216;SmartSource&#8217; which gives you everything you need to know (including the product key). I haven&#8217;t had time to test much lately (I expect Vista Beta 2 in the mail soon). Anyway, why are you reading this? Go download. ([Source][2])
