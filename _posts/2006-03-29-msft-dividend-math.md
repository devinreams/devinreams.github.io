On it&#8217;s face a [9-cent dividend sounds pretty weak][1]&#8230;

Quite the opposite is true in Microsoft&#8217;s case. We need to keep in mind how many shares will receive those 9-cents. So, if you don&#8217;t have the number of outstanding shares offhand that&#8217;s fine, we&#8217;ll do some quick math.

Looking at [Google Finance][2] tells me that Microsoft&#8217;s market cap is $279.21 billion. &#8216;Market cap&#8217; means market capitalization&#8230; which means &#8216;how much the company is worth&#8217;. Naturally, public company&#8217;s worth is based on their stock.

So, since we have Microsoft&#8217;s market cap we know that it&#8217;s calculated by taking the number of outstanding shares and multiplying it by the stock price.

<p align="center">
  Market Cap = Number of Shares x Price Per Share
</p>

Since we have 2 of the 3 numbers (market cap and price per share) we can essentially solve for the number of shares:

<div align="center">
  279.21 = 27.02x, <em>or</em>279.21/27.02 = Number of Shares
</div>

So, Microsoft has over **10 billion shares** outstanding. We can then multiply that by our dividend of .09 and we realize that a whopping $900,000,000 will be returned to shareholders. It&#8217;s all about how you present these things. Which headline is more captivating:

<p align="center">
  Microsoft announces 9-cent dividend, <em>or</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Microsoft returns nearly $1 billion to investors
</p>

As you can see, even a penny from Microsoft is certainly no minor thing. See kids? Accounting *can* be fun!

PS: Gates holds a little over a billion shares. He&#8217;ll be receiving a check for a mere $92,474,940.24.
