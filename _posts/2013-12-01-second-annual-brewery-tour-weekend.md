For the second year in a row, I hosted some friends from the east coast on a tour of Colorado breweries.

The long weekend begun on Thursday, November 7, 2013 and contained over two dozen check-ins at various breweries, eateries, and coffee shops around the Denver metro area (and Fort Collins).

Thursday consisted of&#8230;

*   starting a late lunch at [Euclid Hall][1], one of my favorite downtown restaurants with an excellent beer selection
*   then stopping by [Prost Brewing][2] before happy hour (where a lawyer meetup was convening?)
*   then [Wynkoop Brewing Co.][3] for some pre-dinner drinks
*   then swung by [Lucky Pie in LoDo][4] for some pizza and, yet again, good local beer

Friday included&#8230;

*   a (not early enough) start at [Snooze][5], one of the busiest but tastiest spots for breakfast and brunch in downtown Denver
*   [Crema][6], for a quick hipster-filled caffeine pick-me-up
*   a tour of the [Stranahan&#8217;s distillery][7], some of the best whiskey made in Colorado
*   then swinging by [Breckenridge Brewery&#8217;s][8] 471 Kalamath location for some unique beers
*   then a stop by [TRVE][9] for some hard-core metal brews
*   followed by a stop-over at [Renegade Brewing][10] to have one of my local favorites: [<strike>REDACTED</strike>][11]
*   a delicious dinner at [My Brother&#8217;s Bar][12], the oldest continually operating bar in Denver 

Saturday comprised of&#8230;

*   a world-class breakfast at [Wooden Spoon][13], one of my favorite bakeries
*   then a drive up to Fort Collins where we kicked the morning off with world-class coffee at [Harbinger Coffee][14]
*   [Equinox Brewing][15], a quaint brewery
*   [CooperSmith&#8217;s Pub & Brewing][16], a long-time brewery (before microbrews were trendy)
*   [funkwerks][17], one of the best, lesser-known saison specialists
*   [Odell][18], with one of the best flagstone &#8220;front yards&#8221; in town
*   [Hogshead Brewery][19], the tastiest cask-aged, English ales this side of the pond

Sunday wound down with:

*   a delicious, early breakfast at [Sassafras][20], quality southern cooking
*   Crema again, for good measure
*   a trip to [Epic Brewing][21], the prettiest warehouse and tasting room in River North
*   [Crooked Stave at The Source][22], the best sour beers in the best cluster of butchers, bakers, and restaurants in River North
*   [Mile High Spirits][23], a great menu of local-made spirits
*   [Our Mutual Friend][24], with one of my favorite &#8216;session&#8217; beers around

All in all, looking back at this list it was a busy weekend with a lot of quality stops along the way. If you&#8217;re in Denver, I highly recommend checking out any and all of these venues.
