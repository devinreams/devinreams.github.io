This weekend was the third iteration of [Community Next][1] and it was focused on developing for platforms (in other words: how to make money off of Facebook). I&#8217;ve been tossing around some ideas myself and only needed to listen to one or two panels to determine following:

*   **The &#8220;bubble&#8221; has decentralized.** Instead of one big commotion over something called &#8220;the internet&#8221; we&#8217;ve created dozens, if not hundreds, of mini-bubbles that all involved parties convince each other is the most important thing right now.
*   **Mini-bubbles can make mega-money.** Each new concept (Facebook platform, website widgets) only grows the pool even furthur which means more talent, more money, more excitement, repeat.
*   **Most people don&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; Facebook.** Social networks are the first websites that both nerds and normals can use together and overlap. Nerds build the applications, though. In other words, millions of college kids (normals) put &#8220;who reads?&#8221; as their favorite book whilst nerds create applications to list your favorite book, current reads, and your personal review of them all.
*   **There is no formula to success.** Just because your application or idea is viral doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;ll attract millions of users. Just because it&#8217;s rich in features doesn&#8217;t mean people will use it any more frequent. You can&#8217;t look at success with such a checklist approach.
*   **Switching costs are lower.** Thanks to thousands of app developers if I think your Office Quotes application sucks it only takes three clicks to get a replacement. We&#8217;re picky, we&#8217;ve made the big decisions (Facebook v MySpace) but the rest are so easy. Do it right.
*   **Noah sure knows how to make money.** It&#8217;s wise to build a conference and a reputation of bringing smart people together. Being able to repeat it every 3 months with a new idea (thus, group) is perfect.

I don&#8217;t know if anyone agrees or disagrees with me so I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts. In fact, I&#8217;d love to hear what [Noah Kagan][2], [Dave Feinleib][3], [Dave McClure][4], [Andrew Chen][5], [Rodney Rumford][6] and anyone else at [CommunityNext][1] think/thought.
