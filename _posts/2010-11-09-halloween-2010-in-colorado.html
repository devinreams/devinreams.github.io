I've been enjoying Halloween in Denver for as long as I can remember. This year, though largely uneventful, seemed particularly memorable.

<h3>Excellent weather</h3>

Surprisingly, this year was not snowy or cold. The running joke is that the first snow always falls on Halloween in Colorado and kids have to dress in their costumes with big winter jackets underneath. Instead, the leaves were falling and it felt like fall.

<h3>Pumpkin carving party</h3>

I've never been one to carve a pumpkin on my own. There would always be carving at home with the family, scooping out seeds, baking them, etc. Ever since college I never really did much with pumpkins on halloween. This year, we went to a pumpkin carving party with some friends and I realized that is what holidays are for: being with friends, family, drinking beer, and having fun making silly things together.

<h3>Baking and treats</h3>

I've never had so many excellent treats baked for halloween. Everything from finger-shaped pretzels to sugar cookies and cake. Every holiday needs cookies and cakes.

<h3>Night at the Museum</h3>

The <a href="http://www.dmns.org/">Denver Museum of Nature and Science</a> has an excellent adult education program and this month they had a speaker come in and talk about bats. Not only was the topic fitting for the time, but he also brought bats with him. I've never seen a bat so close in person. This is one of my favorite things about being down in the city: this was a spur-of-the-moment trip to the museum just 10 minutes away on a weekday night.

<h3>The Walking Dead premiere</h3>

Zombies are awesome. The fact there is a new series dedicated to zombies (and not just a corny or scary movie) is exciting. I've stopped watching television regularly and switched to pure Hulu, Netflix and the occasional DVR'd show. But, The Walking Dead is something I can see adding to my weekly schedule.

<h3>No parties, no costumes</h3>

I guess the thing about this year is that there's been this point reached where there's no pressure to do what's "cool" with regard to parties, costumes, going out, and so on. Halloween this year was simple, fun, and filled with plenty of things that I enjoy. I'm looking forward to more holidays...
