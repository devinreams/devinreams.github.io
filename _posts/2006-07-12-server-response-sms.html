If I can find just one person who understands <a href="http://lizrevision.com/lol/sms-shorthand-for-geeks-using-server-response-codes">these codes</a> that'd make my <strike>day</strike> year. I don't know why but I'd get a certain amount of pleasure using server response codes to converse. Someday, I can imagine this moving into everyday conversation, just like 'lol' and 'omg' I can tell that girl that her dress is 406.
