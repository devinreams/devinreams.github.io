I&#8217;m often asked what I&#8217;m wearing on my wrist (it&#8217;s a [Nike FuelBand][1]) and then folks chime in with &#8220;ah yes, my friend has a different one&#8221; which then leads to a discussion of the pros and cons of the various fitness trackers out there.

I&#8217;ve been happy with the FuelBand[^1] just because its an easy measure. And with any tracking (weight, calories, time spent watching TV) until you measure, you don&#8217;t know how to adjust your behavior.

So, to folks who want to learn more, I recommend: reading the article at [The Wirecutter comparing the various fitness trackers][2], start tracking, and then adjust your behavior accordingly.

[^1]:    It has broken once but was promptly replaced. For what it&#8217;s worth, my daily goal is 3,000 &#8220;fuel&#8221; and I&#8217;m on a 34 day streak. I walk to and from work every day which is about 3 miles round-trip.
