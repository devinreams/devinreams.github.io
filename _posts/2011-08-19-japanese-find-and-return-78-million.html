>In the five months since the disaster struck, people have turned in thousands of wallets found in the debris, containing $48 million in cash. More than 5,700 safes that washed ashore along Japan's tsunami-ravaged coast ... Inside those safes officials found $30 million in cash.

Whaaaaat? I'm trying to picture the ecstasy I enjoy when I find a $10 bill left in my winter jacket when returning to the first day of the ski season. Then I try to multiply that feeling by 7.8 x 10^6.
