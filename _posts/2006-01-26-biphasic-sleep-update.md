I&#8217;ve survived week one of my biphasic sleep schedule. Before I started my new routine I would get probably 8 or 9 hours of sleep per night. Last night I settled with 4.5. Here&#8217;s how the last 7 days looked:

    As you can see I started to get less sleep&#8230; then day 4 hit me. I got back from skiing that day and went to take my nap&#8230; and didn&#8217;t wake up until 4am. That was fine, I woke up and proceeded to begin my day. I guess I was pretty exhausted, though.

    Yesterday (day 7) I was very busy. Up at 6, class at 8 then work until 3:30, group project, meeting, dinner, meeting and I was finally home by 9. The problem was I had not started any homework and it needed to be done. So, I worked through my nap time and just decided to do the one block of sleep. That went pretty well. I woke up this morning but was a little drowsy. I lied down and watched MTV until about 6:30.

    &#8230;and here I am working through my nap again. Oddly enough with 4.5 hours of sleep and no nap yet I&#8217;m feeling great. A little more irritable (thanks <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/01/26/computers-crash/">computer</a>!) but not tired at all. I intend to repeat last night&#8217;s schedule and then go back to naps tomorrow afternoon.

    I really recommend trying this sleep schedule. Waking up is easier. My dreams are more memorable, vivid and lucid (I feel like I control them, it&#8217;s weird). Working during the peace of night is great, too. I caught up on 12 magazines, I&#8217;ve started a new web project (looking forward to sharing that soon) and watched some good movies. Life is good!
