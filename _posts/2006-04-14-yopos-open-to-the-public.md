I&#8217;ve decided to open up the [yopos network][1] (young professionals) to applicants. Originally we were an invitation-only group with big ideas. I decided we&#8217;d get more out of yopos if it became a community. More details are on [the blog][2].

As of right now we have a [forum][3] and introductions are under-way. I can&#8217;t wait to get people actively involved. Perosonally, I have a few ideas I&#8217;d like to see in place&#8230; I just need some help.

Take a look at yopos and if it appears to be a group you can relate to then, by all means, leave a comment or shoot an email.
