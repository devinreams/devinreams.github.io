I was bored and I realized how much fun pictures are. Seriously, I love the vast amount of media (video, [pictures][1], [comics][2], [audio][3]) online. I decided I was going to try to post a new picture on Flickr every day (until I run out of bandwith (or stop being cheap)). I posted a few today and created corresponding groups. The first is a [picture of my keys][4]; I&#8217;m interested in what everyone elses&#8217; key chain looks like. The second is a screengrab from my semi-secret [Facebook friends photo mosaic][5]. Yay pictures!
