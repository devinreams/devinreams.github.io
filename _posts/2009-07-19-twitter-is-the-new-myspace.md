I get a lot of good emails but Rachel made a great observation today:

> Not only is &#8220;Spongebob&#8221; a trending topic on Twitter, but it&#8217;s &#8220;Wich Spongebob.&#8221; The fact that we have gazillions of people taking quizzes about their similarity to a Spongebob character is sad, but not nearly as sad as the fact that the word &#8216;which&#8217; is being so persistently misspelled.

Twitter has become MySpace.

We knew it was coming when celebrities showed up. We knew the site was a big deal even before the illegally stolen, internal, not-for-public-consumption documents were released.

The obvious difference being the &#8220;openness&#8221; of Twitter. MySpace, Facebook, etc. required at least some level of friendship to get to people&#8217;s intimate details. Not to mention this level of aggregation, which is only skimming the surface, has never been so public before The original beauty of Twitter was the quick-yet-personal musings that everyone could see (private profiles are often condemed by &#8220;social media experts&#8221;) and chose to follow. 

But now the rest of the world is here and it&#8217;s a bit frightening. Its not the small ecosystem that we initially enjoyed being a part of. Senators, porn stars, real estate agents, company executives: they&#8217;re all here. Plus, everything is indexed, searchable, retweetable, and easy to find.

I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw more people revert back to a more &#8220;closed&#8221; system in the near future. We are teetering on the edge of novel and unnerving.
