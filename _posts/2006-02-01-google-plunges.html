The inevitable has finally happened. Google set the bar pretty high for itself (and others) and they've finally reached the top. This news should come as no surprise; we just weren't sure when it would happen. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/13759492.htm">GOOG dropped 13% yesterday in after-hours trading</a>.
