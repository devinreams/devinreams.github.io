Vacation was great, I got lots of naps. Road trips are cool like that. Plus, it got me away from the record heat here in Colorado (something like 95+ for the last few days). Anyway, I had plenty of time to do some thinking and sort out my thoughts. Once I got back I started calling all kinds of people and started working on some projects: 

*   One is a web comic,
*   One is a podcast,
*   One is a website for musicians,
*   One is a CRM website with a twist,
*   One is a little badge/applet for bloggers, and
*   One is re-organizing and re-energizing [yopos][1].

There&#8217;s just so much to do. Plus I work maybe 60-70 hours a week. Busy busy! Oh, and then there&#8217;s having a life; I&#8217;ll be playing DDR with a friend tonight. I guess that doesn&#8217;t count though&#8230;

&#8230;unfortunately I didn&#8217;t read as much as I had hoped. How ironic is it that I didn&#8217;t get around to finishing *Getting Things Done*?)

PS: Congratulations to all [the new 9rulers][2]!
