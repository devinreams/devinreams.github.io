*[Ben asked and answered the question][1], [Chris added his two cents][2], now it&#8217;s my turn: Is college really necessary?*

Let me be blunt: **categorically yes**.

Despite the complaining I couldn&#8217;t be happier with the college experience. Everyone should do it. The dorms on the other hand&#8230; that&#8217;s another story. Ben says he loves college becuase he&#8217;s met some very smart and capable people. I, too, would cite that as a good reason to go to college: **networking**.

When you&#8217;re in college, odds are you&#8217;re not entirely responsible for your own finances. This means you have some freedom as to what you do during this time. Personally, I&#8217;ve taken on three (simultanious) jobs, a business fraternity, and a few of my own side projects. If I ever screw any of these things up, that&#8217;s okay, **I&#8217;ll learn from it; I won&#8217;t get fired**. Well, I *might* get fired, but my well-being certainly isn&#8217;t at stake. Additionally, I don&#8217;t have anyone (a family) relying on my actions. As Chris put it, &#8220;*life will hit you square in the face*&#8220;, and you&#8217;ll (hopefully) figure things out pretty quickly.

Keep in mind though, you only get out of college the energy you put in. People will not bump into you and introduce themselves; you have to get out and get involved. **Join organizations** and find people who share similar interests. High school forced you into the same classes with the same people. Friendship was merely by association. In college you&#8217;re forced to make decisions: you decide who you are, what classes you&#8217;ll take, who you&#8217;ll associate with, who you&#8217;ll trust, who you&#8217;ll emulate, etc. Again, the **people play a big role** in college.

Sure, you learn a lot but just about anyone can pick up a book and absorb the same information. Heck, you could get a job and gain all the experience you could ever need. But, as I mentioned, college provides that time for you to slow down and make some conscious decisions. For those of you in college I pose the following question:

<p align="center">
  <strong>What is it that you&#8217;re best at? What is the one thing you can do better than anyone else on your campus?</strong>

  College is a perfect time to apply the <a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/lab/hedgehog/">hedgehog concept</a>. You have 3, 4, maybe even 8 years to find the answer. I suggest, as Chris has so brilliantly demonstrated through GTA and Blind Date, that you <strong>spend that time wisely</strong>. You&#8217;ll never get it back&#8230;
