Here&#8217;s a great article on the [shift in technology popularity and values from Francisco Dao at PandoDaily][1]:

> In San Francisco, one need only look at conference speaker line-ups that often consists of people who haven’t accomplished anything except raising an angel round and amassing Twitter followers to see that we’re doing the same thing [as Hollywood]. The result is we’ve created a culture of tech celebs who, like Paris Hilton, are famous for little or nothing.

Reminds me a bit of what I was talking about with [Charlie][2] back in 2010 about those [attempting to find success in celebrity][3].

As [Mike Davidson][4] elegantly put it:

> If you want to be influential, lead by doing, not by talking, and certainly not by duping. If what you create is really good, other people will talk about it for you.
