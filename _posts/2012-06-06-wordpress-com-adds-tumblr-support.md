This post by [Matt Mullenweg][1] is pretty insightful:

> WordPress has fantastic content that people on Tumblr love, and Tumblr has a rich and diverse content and curation community that can drive new visitors to WordPress — it’s like peanut butter and chocolate.

And I&#8217;ve felt exactly the same way, actually. Near the end of the ski season I noticed [Jason Kottke][2] had essentially duplicated his entire web experience on Tumblr just to allow users to *properly* repost, follow, and share his content.

I thought this was genius and started researching ways I could do this myself for [Colorado Snow][3], which is self-hosted on WordPress. So, while you wait anxiously for Jetpack to add Tumblr support simply add the [Tumblrize plugin][4] and get started.

*   Question #1: Does this shut down the Tumblr versus WordPress.com &#8220;monthly traffic&#8221; and &#8220;active blog&#8221; statistics and comparisons? Probably.
*   Question #2: Will Tumblr get anxious about this and the potential for duplicate content, abuse, etc.? Probably not, eyeballs are eyeballs.

PS: Here&#8217;s my [Colorado Snow blog on Tumblr][5], it only took about 5 minutes to set up and configure.
