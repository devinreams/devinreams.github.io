The folks over at <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> have put out <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2164-picking-a-firm-from-sortfolio-to-redesign-signal-vs-noise">a request for firms to apply to redesign their blog</a>. This is a simple request with everything I need to evaluate the project: budget, timeline, scope, deliverable, and expectations. All of this is brilliantly captured within 324 words. Every day I wade through 30-slide PowerPoints and 12-page RFPs I truly wish more people were this straightforward. Frankly, in my experience, some of the simplest project requests work out the best.
