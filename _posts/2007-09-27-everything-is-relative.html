Everything is relative. I've been conducting an informal survey for a little while now: when I ask for 'lots and lots of ketchup' at the Chik-Fil-A drive-through I will receive either a) lots and lots of ketchup or b) three or four packets. The determining factor: how busy the Chik-Fil-A is. Something tells me if you work there and you hand out a dozen packets to a dozen cars in 5 minutes in a row you seem like you're giving away too much. But, give away a dozen packets to a dozen cars in 30 minutes and you're doing what you're supposed to. (I think I'll start saying 'fill the bag with ketchup'.)
