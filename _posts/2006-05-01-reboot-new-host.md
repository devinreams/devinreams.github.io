Two things about the site: first, I went ahead and purchased (first time, ever) a webhost. So far I highly recommend [Dreamhost][1]. Second, I did the lamest &#8216;Reboot&#8217; in the history of [CSS Reboot][2]. I took my default K2 theme and changed it into what you see here. Plain white, a little red, and my clever logo. As mentioned, I&#8217;m also [trying Adsense][3] but I doubt it will get me far.
