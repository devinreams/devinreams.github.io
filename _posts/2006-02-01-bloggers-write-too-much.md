Dear Bloggers,

Many of you (including yours truly) write too much!

I want to point you to A List Apart which wrote on &#8216;[How to Write a Better Blog][1]&#8216; back in 2002. A number of bloggers write like &#8216;amateurs&#8217;. I don&#8217;t mean that literally, that&#8217;s just how the article labels these individuals.

I think we can all agree there is almost too much content to keep up with. I submit that we all do each other a favor and become more aware of our own writing styles.

> Declarative sentences are good. Web readers demand pith.

Steve Rubel is *very* good at blogging. If everyone emulated his style I could get through my feeds a hundred times faster and absorb a thousand times more content. For example, see how long it takes to read the following:

> Pheedo [launched a new RSS ad unit][2] that displays PR Web press releases. In other words, press releases &#8211; dressed up as ads &#8211; are coming to an RSS feed near you. ([Micro Persuasion][3])

By the end of that second sentence I know *everything* I need to know. If I really want to get more information I&#8217;d either read on, click the link, or do both. Steve is a very good writer (good thing, given his job) and is very good at getting to the point.

Short-and-sweet is easier to do when creating news-like entries, but what about in-depth original content? Well, Seth Godin is an amazingly concise, yet extrmely insightful writer:

> Human beings respond to emergencies. It&#8217;s easy to get everyone to take action if we&#8217;re in the middle of some sort of security crisis&#8230; but fixing the educational system isn&#8217;t going to happen. ([Seth&#8217;s Blog][4])

Again, these sentences are quick and to the point. There is no dancing around with extra descriptions and examples. This makes reading his blog extremely useful.

I hate to say this, but when a post from [Business Logs][5] shows up I often ignore it. Their entires are great, don&#8217;t get me wrong. A full page of words is hard to read though. For example, the following:

> &#8220;I&#8217;m a little torn here, so I&#8217;m in need of some good comment-based advice ? it&#8217;s regarding my impending purchase of a laptop, or should I say, a palm-top.&#8221; ([Business Logs][6])

&#8230;could quickly become:

> &#8220;I need some advice regarding a laptop (or should I say palm-top) purchase.&#8221;

Mike, no offense, I too have found myself saying more than I need to.

I also found a post the other day that seemed to drag on. I wanted to find out about how to make my PC look like OSX. The following:

> &#8220;To make a long story short, I love the fluidity of the Frutiger font family, so I tried (unsuccessfully) to snag the Frutiger Next type face. I did, however, manage to snag the original version of Frutiger, which I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re supposed to be able to get without a license. Believe it or not, I got the font courtesy of Microsoft, simply because they bundle the font with [Microsoft Reader][7].&#8221; ([pearsonified][8])

&#8230;is really just saying:

> &#8220;I looked for Frutiger Next because I love the fluidity of the Frutiger font family. I guess you don&#8217;t need a license for Frutiger becuase I snagged it via the Microsoft Reader.&#8221;

Like I said, I don&#8217;t mean to offend, Chris. My point is, I&#8217;m less likely to subscribe to (or read) paragraphs of &#8216;stream of consciousness&#8217; (but I did try out [FlyakiteOSX][9]; thanks for the pointer!).

I could go on highlighting long-winded individuals but I think the point has been made. A little bit of editing could go a long way&#8230;

Keep in mind I&#8217;m not trying to be as constructive as it may seem. I&#8217;m selfishly asking people to get to the point so I have more time to read my long-winded accounting textbooks&#8230; ;-)
