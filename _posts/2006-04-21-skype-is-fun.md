I haven&#8217;t been a big Skype user. Frankly, becuase nobody I typically socialize with has even heard of it. But, a select few have &#8216;converted&#8217; and I&#8217;ve been playing with it more. [Jeremy][1] was the one I was primarily using it with but now I&#8217;ve got a reason to use it more: SkypeOut and SkypeIn.

Haha, I have a phone number&#8230; it took forever to find, too:

  I&#8217;ve hit an all-time low on the nerd scale&#8230; but I love it. It&#8217;s so simple and the minutes are pretty cheap ($10 got me 10 hours). I&#8217;m excited to try this stuff out some more. I&#8217;m actually ordering a bluetooth headset off eBay tonight. I&#8217;ll let you know how that goes.

  In any case, if you&#8217;re a Skype user feel free to add me and if you&#8217;re looking to call and harass me, feel free to leave a voicemail! Every person who leaves a voicemail will get added to my soon-to-be links list. ;-)

  PS: I think $12 for a new phone number isn&#8217;t bad. For those of us without a &#8216;Home&#8217; number this is the perfect solution. Now I don&#8217;t have to worry about giving out my cell number. You too can be a dork!
