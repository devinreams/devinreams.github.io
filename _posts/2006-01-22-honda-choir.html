It looks like not only <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/01/18/brilliant-marketing-on-youtube/">Nike</a>, but <a href="http://www.honda.co.uk/civic/">Honda also understands how to advertise</a>. The commercial found on their site (skip the flash, 'Watch') is a classic example of something so neat it'll get passed around very quickly. How do I know? Popular demand has made the 'making of' video unavailable.. Honda also gets bonus points for making a downloadable podcast version available. No longer does someone have to rip the ad and put it on their site... well, maybe someone should anyway since Honda's own site can't handle the downloads.
