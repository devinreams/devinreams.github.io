[If the rumors are true, Apple may be planning a new product launch to coincide with the 10th anniversary of their retail stores.][1] The stores have been wildly successful and much of Apple&#8217;s growth may likely be attributed to them. So what can Apple release that would get bodies into the malls? What haven&#8217;t they done already? Here&#8217;s all I can come up with:

* Digital alarm clock  
* [Flip phone][2]  
* Electric toothbrush  
* [Blu-ray][3] player  
* Video Game console  
* Plasma TV  
* [E Ink reader][4]  
* Electric shaver  
* Microwave  
* \[Vacuum\](http://www.dyson.com/)  
* Fridge  
* Hybrid vehicle  
* \[Digital wristwatch\](http://www.rolex.com/)  
* 3D glasses  
* [Vinyl record player][5]

That&#8217;s the exhaustive list of items I&#8217;ve been able to compile. Who&#8217;s ready to start some bets?
