I&#8217;m glad to have my taxes done and out of the way. This year (2008) was far simpler than 2006, or 2007. Back in college I had up to seven simultaneous jobs. The paperwork was painful. This year I&#8217;m down to two W-2s, my Roth IRA will be maxed out ($5,000 contribution limit, FYI) and life is good. Oh, and since I was such a charitable guy (donations to United Way), Colorado owes me $200. Sweet.

But, I learned one painful lesson: if you have started a return with [TurboTax][1] you cannot downgrade to a lesser version of the product. This makes *some* sense because you&#8217;re given &#8220;advice&#8221; with some of the advanced products. But, TurboTax will not let you start over, reset, or downgrade. You have to create a *brand new account* which means your prior-year returns are no longer accessible from the same account. So I can go all the way through the process of filing, up to the point of hitting &#8216;submit&#8217; (and maximize deductions, receive advice, etc.) and then start over for free.

I can&#8217;t make this up, from the [TurboTax FAQ][2]:

> Once you&#8217;ve started preparing your tax return with TurboTax Online, you can upgrade your TurboTax Online product to Deluxe, Home &#038; Business or Premier to take advantage of the extra features and tax guidance available in those products. After you&#8217;ve upgraded to one of these versions, your tax information will transfer to the upgraded version automatically. However, to switch back to a lower-priced version, you&#8217;ll need to start a new return with a different User ID, as there is no option to switchback to the previous version once you have upgraded your product.

Fail.
