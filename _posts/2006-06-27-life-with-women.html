I've taken on a fun little project, a webcomic. I have little-to-no artistic ability but I have a lot of funny material. I'm debating, though, do the comic in MS Paint or draw by hand? Anyway, the comic is called <a href="http://lifewithwomen.com/">Life With Women</a> and I plan to provide a weekly dose of entertainment. If you just read this thinking I'm sexist or perhaps offensive, that's fine, it just means you didn't <a href="http://lifewithwomen.com/">go visit the site and read my introduction</a>.
