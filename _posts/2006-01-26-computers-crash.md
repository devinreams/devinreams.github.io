Why the hell is it that computers will crash and eff up **if and only if **you&#8217;re in the middle of a pretty important task? Honestly. I was having website issues the other day and then this evening Windows crashed *hard* (and by hard I mean it rebooted saying it had to do registry recovery, none of my cookies are saved, etc.). This is such a waste of my time. All those days I sit around poking people on Facebook though, nothing! Not even a frozen browser&#8230; thanks [Murphy][1].
