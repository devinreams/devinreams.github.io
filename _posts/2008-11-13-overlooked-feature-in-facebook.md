When the new site design launched nobody realized that Facebook added the &#8216;Top Friends&#8217; functionality:

[<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/3029018760_ca4e13604b.jpg" width="450" height="497" alt="Always Show These Friends" />][1]

I don&#8217;t see [TechCrunch][2], [Mashable][3], or anyone noticing this. But everyone was very quick to get upset when slide&#8217;s &#8216;Top Friends&#8217; app was taken down (it was a [legitimate security concern][4]).

I hate this short-term-memory-loss-lynch-mob we like to call the internet. Uproar and knee jerk reactions over perfectly understandable non-issues. But no praise for the good anyone does. It seems the consensus is: &#8220;let&#8217;s move on to something else we can get upset about&#8221;. This is why [Valleywag is dead][5]. Nobody likes complainers. Do something about it. On the other hand, this is the same pandering nature that network news channels commit every day. The same ones that &#8220;we&#8221; bloggers say we&#8217;re up against.

Oh, and if you&#8217;re still reading and waiting for the punch-line, here you go. From the [Facebook help][6] page taken today:

The internet is weird.
