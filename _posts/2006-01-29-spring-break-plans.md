Another dual-purpose post. First off, Facebook has added &#8216;Spring Break Plans&#8217; to profiles so you can let your friends know how cool you are. Personally, I&#8217;m tossing around the idea of going to Spain. I have a friend studying in Barcelona and I figure it would fun. Anyway, I hope my friends check my profile and realize how cool that makes me.
