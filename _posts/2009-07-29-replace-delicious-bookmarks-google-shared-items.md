[Google Reader][1] has only recently added social features ([following, liking, people searching][2]) but I&#8217;ve found them to be amazingly powerful.

### Consuming information

If you use Google Reader, you likely consume a lot of information through it via RSS feeds. Everything from news ([BBC][3], [NYTimes][4]), [sports][5], humor ([ICHC][6], [xkcd][7]) to photos from your Flickr contacts, [Twitter mentions][8] and so on. Reader is one of my most important online web applications.

### Consolidated contacts

And to pile on even more Google fanaticism (friends in college thought I worked for Google), all of my friends and family contact information are stored in [Google Contacts][9]. The best part about this is that my Gmail, Google Voice, iPhone and Address Book contacts are all pointing to the same place: Google. Some argue that&#8217;s a bad idea, but that&#8217;s another discussion. Point being: there&#8217;s no need for me to try and messily sync lots of contacts across multiple sites.

### Google Shared items

Since Google now has public pages to display your &#8216;Shared&#8217; items (through Google Reader, you can have one spot where you consume *and* share the cool content you find. In essence, you can help filter the signal from the noise for your contacts and friends.

<div style="text-align:center;margin:15px;">
  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/G05Obt4qYboTflip8UTjgQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCITl2NK_tvvl5AE&#038;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_CLIldRqAOho/SnD_AjVhwGI/AAAAAAAAAI0/TfZaBNS4mp8/s400/google-reader-share.png" /></a>
</div>

Once you share an item, other people that &#8216;follow&#8217; you will be notified of the new item. Awesome, I can read consume new cool things that my friends have filtered.

### Replace delicious bookmarks altogether

If you visit your Shared settings page (Your stuff > Shared items > Sharing settings) and scroll to the bottom of the page, you&#8217;ll notice:

> Try the Note in Reader bookmarklet to share non-feed items from around the web.

Drag and drop the &#8216;Note in Reader&#8217; link to your browser&#8217;s bookmarks toolbar and suddenly you can &#8216;share&#8217; content from all over the web. Friend linked to something cool on Twitter? No problem, just &#8216;Note in Reader&#8217; and everyone else knows about it. Tags and comment come standard. It&#8217;s that easy.
