Congrats to the team over at [Untappd][1] for launching their native iPhone and Android apps last week. I&#8217;ve been beta testing for a bit and this is a *much improved* experience over the mobile browser experience. It&#8217;s much faster, allows photo uploads, and has a handy &#8220;notifications&#8221; center. If you like beer and haven&#8217;t heard of Untappd, these guys have become the de facto standard for &#8220;checking in&#8221; to your drinks. It&#8217;s been really fun to explore new tastes and discover what types I like.
