Not everything I do online ends up here on my blog so I figured I&#8217;d point to an article I wrote on [Women and Minority Entrepreneurs][1], [resting on your laurels][2], [priorities][3], and [whether entrepreneurship can be taught][4]. Additionally I&#8217;ve started a project documenting myself on video every day for 60 seconds. I&#8217;m on day five over at [Mind Averse][5].
