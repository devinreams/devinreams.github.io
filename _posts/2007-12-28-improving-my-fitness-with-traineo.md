I&#8217;ve decided it was time to focus a bit more on my personal health including my diet and exercise:

*   **First Step: Joined a gym since moving.** I&#8217;ve paid for the membership which allows me M/W/F/Sun access. I also scheduled 9-10pm on my calendar so that I keep it on my radar.
*   **Second Step: Paid attention to what I eat.** I&#8217;ve created my [traineo][1] [account][2] in order to track my diet (both quality and quantity). I use [FitDay][3] to quickly reference what kinds of calories I&#8217;m really eating.
*   **Third Step: Paid attention to my activities.** I&#8217;ve never really been aware of how active I am but by using traineo I can start to chart and improve my weekly workouts.

It&#8217;s not revolutionary but I&#8217;ve realized just being more aware of something can help you on your way to improving it.
