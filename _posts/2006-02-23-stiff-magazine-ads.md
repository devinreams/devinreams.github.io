Dear Marketers,

Want to know the best way for me to hate you, your product, and anything remotely related to you? Put a stiff page in a magazine. If you&#8217;re really going for the gold, make sure I can&#8217;t remove it. I want to be reminded of you everytime I try to place my magazine on a surface. Any surface.

Seriously, that&#8217;s exactly why I bought the subscription.

It&#8217;s not like I ever try to have the magazine open very often. But when I do, make sure your ad is in there keeping the pages from easily turning. That shows class.

I don&#8217;t care how much exposure the publisher promised you. Send them a message: you don&#8217;t want your future clients to hate you. I think it&#8217;s a solid message to send.

Think about it: do you really want to be associated with tearing, ripping, anger, and my trash can? Sure, your ad was seen once&#8230;

&#8230;but we all know how quickly that ended.

Thanks for listening!
