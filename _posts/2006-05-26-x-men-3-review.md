Not too shabby. The acting was a bit corny. I realize this movie has to cater to the lowest common denomenator. You really didn&#8217;t have to think much, it was all handed to you on a platter. Not only do they hint at something once, but they make sure to revisit it later in case you forgot&#8230; or were asleep the first time.

Much of it was overdramatic. Additionally, there was so many &#8220;big&#8221; things thrown around in this plot; it seemed to be trying too hard.

Overall it was fun. Slight humor here and there. A bit of drama. Lots of exploding. It was fun to revisit the story again but I&#8217;m probably going to forget how this one goes just like I did the last two. Seriously, I totally forgot who Jean was for a minute.

Oh, and stick around for the very very ending. There&#8217;s a tad more after the credits&#8230;
