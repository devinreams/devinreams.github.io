At [Crowd Favorite][1], we often have the privilege of working with some very cool [clients][2]. These last few weeks we worked closely with [MailChimp][3] to help release a WordPress plugin called [Analytics360&deg;][4].

From the [MailChimp blog][5]:

> &#8230;it uses the power of Google Analytics to tell bloggers what kind of an effect they’re having on overall website traffic. We’ve made it super easy to tell if your blog posts (and email campaigns) are driving traffic to your website&#8230;

There has already been a lot of [nice things said on Twitter][6], and over [1,000 downloads][7]. Check out [the video][8] to learn a bit more about how it works:

</div>

Overall, this was a great team effort. The folks at MailChimp had a great idea, access to great APIs (both MailChimp and Google Analytics) and a lot of foresight. We at Crowd Favorite were greeted with the challenge and built one of the slickest WordPress analytics plugins out there (those [visualizations][9] are easy, but not *that* easy).
