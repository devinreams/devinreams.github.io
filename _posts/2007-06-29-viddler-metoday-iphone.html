I didn't wait in line for an iPhone today. Largely because I'm on a great MyFaves Family Plan at T-Mobile. Oh, and I love my Pearl. But, today I've started something I attempted to do back in January: a daily video blog. Why? a) I hate failing and b) my favorite guys at <a href="http://www.viddler.com/">Viddler</a> are having a drawing to win an iPhone. <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/sandieman/videos/224/">Go get the details here.</a> <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/devinreams/tags/metoday">Watch me every day right here.</a>
