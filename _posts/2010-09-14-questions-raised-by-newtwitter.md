Twitter, the [non-social network][2] social network has announced a new web interface. 

Some initial observations and questions:

- Why does the [introductory video][3] take nearly 90 seconds to get to the demonstration? That is nearly three times the length of a television commercial. For a company that originated with brevity in mind&#8230; wow.  
- This appears to be a simple effort to move people to Twitter as a product (not a platform that you use other means to access it) in order to control the eyeballs and eventually, add advertising and other means of monetization.  
- How many people use the web interface currently? I doubt this re-design will have the same backlash a site like Facebook expects. Not enough people use the web interface, they&#8217;ve moved to third-party apps and this is a push to get Twitter-proper back in control.  
- Will [Tweetie for Mac][4] ever be updated now? Or is this Twitter&#8217;s approach to become the product \*and\* the platform on desktop computers?  
- How can designers like [TweetyGotBack][5] get back into a competitive position of designing wallpapers with a huge stockpile of existing themes? No matter what they do, they step on the toes that helped get them where they are today.  
- Is there even enough room for wallpapers (with your contact information in the gutter) to even exist on this new design? I surely hope not. Who visits a twitter profile only to go and type in another URL pertaining to how to find you (use the website link in your profile). Social media experts&#8230;

And with that said, I don&#8217;t know why I use Twitter. [Alex][6] and I were chatting and I&#8217;ve come to the realization I get nearly no value from it. Perhaps that speaks to the people I follow. It&#8217;s not that they aren&#8217;t great people, I just don&#8217;t like their online personalities. Instead of the typical nerd values you expect to see from the people you know in person (quiet, smart, witty, polite) you get the vices (self-importance, loud, benign). I&#8217;m the first to admit I look at my profile and realize, I don&#8217;t think I would [follow me][7].
