I don't remember where I stumbled upon these little tricks but I've found myself quite the nifty habit:

Whenever I want to pull up a website (ie, www.devinreams.com) I just type 'devinreams' in the address bar and hit Ctrl-Enter. Both Firefox and IE fill in the http://www. and .com for you!
Think of all the time saved!

<strong>Bonus:</strong> Firefox does the same for .net and .org with Shift-Enter and Alt-Enter, respectively! Reason #1837 why Firefox is so much better!

...ah, who am I kidding? I can't think of one top-level site I visit daily that <em>isn't</em> .com.
