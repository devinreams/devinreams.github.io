Rachel and I took a quick trip to see friends in Boston, MA a few weeks ago. I've finally put the photos online. I love the various web applications out there, here's how I used three to track my trip:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.dopplr.com/trip/devin/375738">DOPPLR:</a> Used to see the 'big picture' when it comes to travel. I've had the trip listed on <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/devin/public">my travel profile</a> for a few weeks here. Magically, dopplr matches up travel dates to my Flickr timeline to show pictures from that trip. Easily one of the cooler features.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/sets/72157608647207356/">Flickr:</a> I uploaded all my photos with the permissions set to 'me and family only'. So, all my pictures are archived and I can go back and essentially 'unblock' the ones I want to share with everyone else. I don't have a GPS-enabled SD card but I can manually geotag the location of these photos and have them show up on a map.</li>
	<li><a href="http://brightkite.com/people/devinreams">Brightkite:</a> Throughout the trip I would 'check in' at the various spots we were at. Now I can go back and look at a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/3004583032/in/set-72157608647207356/">map view of my trip</a>. This helps with tagging photos but is also a really cool way to visualize a trip.</li>
</ol>
So there you have it. Three nerdy sites for one cool trip.
