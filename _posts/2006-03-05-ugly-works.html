Just reading <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/03/04/the-role-of-anti-marketing-design/">this post</a> enrages me. Google isn't ugly. It's simple. Craigslist isn't ugly, it's content-rich. Purple backgrounds with yellow text on Myspace? That's ugly. I will agree though, who cares what a blog looks like? You can't see my pretty header in Bloglines. Blogs are about the content. Don't judge a book by it's cover... well, unless that book is Myspace. In that case you'd be right.
