One more year finished. I had my last final on Tuesday morning... at 7:30. Just thinking about it made me think, "wow, that sucks." It was my database class, too. It certainly wasn't at the top of my list of priorities since I'm pretty proficient at Microsoft Access. In any case, I got a friendly call at 7:45am from a friend in the class... wondering where I was. Apparently my answer was "in bed." I strolled in around 8 and finished up in an hour. I think I was the second one done. I bet I looked like an ass...
