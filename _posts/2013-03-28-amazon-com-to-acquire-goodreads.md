From the [press release](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1801563&highlight=):

> Amazon.com, Inc. today announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire Goodreads, a leading site for readers and book recommendations that helps people find and share books they love.

Daaaaangit. I just moved my reading lists from [Shelfari][1] over to [Goodreads][2] because, get this, Amazon stopped maintaining Shelfari after [purchasing it back in 2008][3]. This doesn&#8217;t bode well for the future of Goodreads&#8230;
