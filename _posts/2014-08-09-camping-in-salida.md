Rachel had accumulated some "dollars" at work through spot recognition and various awards. Those dollars could be exchanged for gift cards, products, and various experiences. So, naturally she picked the best experience these "dollars" could buy: a private [half-day hike with llamas](http://www.spruceridgellamas.com).

We drove out towards Chaffee County, Colorado which is known for its summer activities: whitewater rafting, hiking, fishing, camping. It's not known for llamas but it should be.

After spending the night freely camping on some public land we drove to meet our llama host and hike :walking: the day away. We enjoyed a beautiful leisurely walk through national land, stopped for a picnic lunch, and let the llamas carry everything the whole time. Check out [my photos from our llama hike](http://photos.devin.reams.me/camping-in-salida) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co/).
