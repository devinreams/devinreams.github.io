Another day, another post about Facebook. I was wandering around today and found a few interesting things. First, <a href="http://xiaonei.com/">this site looks familiar</a>. Second, if you login and try to open blast.php you get redirected back to the home page. What does that mean? Well, pages that don't exist will give you a 404; this page actually loads something. Something called a 'blast' is coming soon...
