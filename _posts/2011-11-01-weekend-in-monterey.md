This past weekend Rachel and I visited a friend in Monterey to get away from the sudden snow in Denver and hang out on beaches (that really wasn&#8217;t the reason, but a nice side-effect). We did a bike ride along 17 Mile, visited Pebble Beach, saw excellent sunsets, made a bonfire on the beach, learned how to surf, visited vineyards in Carmel, drove down to Big Sur, and had plenty of great meals.

&#8220;I can see why people live in California.&#8221;
