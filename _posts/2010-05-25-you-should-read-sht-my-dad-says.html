Most books I read are non-fiction and are related to technology, business, or life in general (much like this blog). The "<a href="http://shitmydadsays.com/">Sh*t My Dad Says</a>" book was a pleasantly-surprising story of Justin's life with his irreverent and crass father. I was chuckling and laughing throughout the entire thing. It's a quick read but if you're looking for something light, I highly recommend it. It was the first book I read on the iPad using the iBooks app. Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the experience (but I still learn towards the Kindle as the better platform).
