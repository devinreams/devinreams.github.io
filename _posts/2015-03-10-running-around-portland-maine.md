Since we spent all fall and all winter in Portland, Maine, I came to learn how "a little weather" should never stop me from getting outside and being active.

We had a great time getting to know a new city and running a couple minutes a few times a week was one of the best ways to cover a lot of ground, intimately. Check out [my photos from running around Portland](http://photos.devin.reams.me/running-around-portland) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co/).
