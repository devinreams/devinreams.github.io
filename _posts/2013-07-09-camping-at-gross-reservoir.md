One of the best kept secrets just 45 minutes outside of Denver is Gross Reservoir. It&#8217;s technically US Forest Service land but Denver Water maintains jurisdiction (or something like that) as its one of Denver&#8217;s water supply reservoirs. No human contact nor motorized boats are allowed on the lake (so, canoes and hiking) which means you get a peaceful, quiet, pristine lake largely all to yourselves.

The east side is limited to day hikes, picnicing and launching small watercraft. The west side (from Coal Creek Canyon up Lazy Z Road) becomes dirt road quickly and then the entrance to the camp grounds (all free, 20+ spots, no reservations, no crowds) requires a high-clearance vehicle that can handle a bit of a bumpy, rocky, steep climb. If you have the vehicle it&#8217;s very much worth it as you have the place all to yourself.
