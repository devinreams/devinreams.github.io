My favorite web series is \[Put This On\](http://putthison.com) hosted by Jesse Thorn and Adam Lisagor. In the final installment of Season 1, [Sandy][1] imparts the wise quip: &#8220;Every day put on one piece of clothing that says something about who you are&#8230;&#8221; (I won&#8217;t spoil the punchline),

Guys: go check out all episodes and if you enjoy them you should [support the kickstarter project so we can have a Season 2][2]. If you don&#8217;t, well, \*you&#8217;re\* the reason we can&#8217;t have nice things&#8230;
