<a href="http://9rules.com/relationships/notes/4878/">Are we far too male centric?</a> Recently I've noticed how much wives put up with. From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Daylight-Gene-OKelly/dp/0071471723">Eugene O'Kelly</a> to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413099/">Evan Almighty</a>. And that's just yesterday. It may sound naive but why are we still so very male-centric? <a href="http://9rules.com/relationships/notes/4878/">Discussion at 9rules.</a>
