Not to say the movie wasn&#8217;t entertaining, but, ehh, there were parts that made me cringe. Hard to say because I respect Mr. Bruckheimer so very much. I knew if I went to this movie tonight I&#8217;d regret it. Though, if you&#8217;re a fan it&#8217;s certainly one of those you&#8217;ll need to see in the theatre. Personally, I hate movie theatres and their ability to attract the masses. Apparently the population in my proximity has an IQ less than my shoe size. Anyway, love the soundtrack and some interesting (albeit over the top) fight scenes. Oh, and I love a movie where I&#8217;m part of the 10% that understands the majority of the wtty dialog (whilst the other 90% enjoys the pratfall and slapstick). I guess it has humor for everyone&#8230;
