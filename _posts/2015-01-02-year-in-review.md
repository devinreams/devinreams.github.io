When looking back on the past year I've realized what a fun, crazy, busy and privileged life I lead in 2014. I consider myself very lucky to have the experiences and opportunities I've had: [I started working for GitHub](https://devin.reams.me/2014/chapter-2-github/), Rachel and I enjoyed some great trips together, and we temporarily [moved across the country from Denver to Portland, Maine](https://devin.reams.me/2014/photos-driving-to-maine/)...

This graph shows [my contributions](https://github.com/devinreams) on GitHub.com (Pull Requests, issues opened, and commits) which is where I spent most of my working hours this year. It's fun to see the gaps in activity as the absence of activity tells as much a story as the activities themselves.

Looking at each month of 2014...

## January

In January I started my second chapter of my career by [joining GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1748-devin-reams-is-a-githubber) as a Technical Account Manager. I actually spent every week of January flying back and forth between San Francisco and Denver (I had to ski on the weekends!).

January also included my visiting the [Big Beers, Belgians and Barleywines Festival](http://www.bigbeersfestival.com) in Vail which was one of my favorite conferences, not just because it was all about beer, I've ever attended.

## February

In February a group of friends and I all worked together to raise money for [Hope on the Slopes](http://hopeontheslopes.net), which has raised more than $4 million dollars for the American Cancer Society since 2003.

I didn't get to ski as much as I would hope in February but I definitely tried to make those two days count for something.

## March

In March, Rachel and I decided to buy a new car. We picked up a used 2011 Toyota Prius that had only previously been used as a fleet car. We've been really happy having a "new" car with excellent gas mileage for Rachel's daily commutes.

Later in the month Rachel and I [visited our friends in Boston and Maine](http://photos.devin.reams.me/st-patricks-day). We decided to throw together a mini-trip on our way out to Iceland.

[Visiting Iceland](http://photos.devin.reams.me/iceland) was one of the major highlights of my year. We saw amazing sights, enjoyed road tripping around the island — seeing glaciers, volcanoes, waterfalls, oh my — and learned a lot about the country. Oh, and enjoyed in-water massages!
