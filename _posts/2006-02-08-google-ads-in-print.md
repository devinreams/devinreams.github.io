Wow, print media isn&#8217;t entirely dead but I was definitely convinced that advertising in it was (what are [Seth Godin&#8217;s][1] thoughts?). [Google certainly changed some things today][2]. I had recommended people to steer clear of print advertising but, hey, I apologize: I was wrong. I&#8217;m excited to turn around and recommend print advertising at [work][3] tomorrow!
