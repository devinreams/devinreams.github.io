title: GitHub Flow Talk at Develop Denver
layout: post
---

This past weekend I had the distinct pleasure of [speaking](https://developdenver.org/panel/48) at [Develop Denver](https://developdenver.org/), a local conference for designers and developers in the community. If you're interested, I posted [my slides on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/devinreams/the-github-flow-and-protips-and-new-hotness).

I talked a bit about: [GitHub](https://github.com/) the product and its philosophies, @GitHub the company, and the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). I tried to weave all three together to show how we (and others) use GitHub to work better, together.

As mentioned, I've posted [my slides at Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/devinreams/the-github-flow-and-protips-and-new-hotness) in case you'd like to learning a bit about GitHub along with some tips (and "new hotness") you may not already be aware of. Many thanks to Drew and the Denver development community for having me!
