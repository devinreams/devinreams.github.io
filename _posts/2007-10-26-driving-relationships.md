Is it just me or do you start having relationships with drivers on the road with you? I start calling them by their make, model, and/or color. &#8220;Come on in Green Toyota, you let me merge back there a bit ago.&#8221; Is that silly? Is that just me? Oh, and thanks for cutting me off, Black Cadillac. I hate when people mistake half a car-length as an invitation.
