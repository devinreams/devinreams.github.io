This is such a first world problem I thought about not posting it. But, I feel there&#8217;s an opportunity to make some money and make people happy. I hope I&#8217;m not the first to think of this&#8230;

How often do you come home to a &#8220;missed delivery&#8221; notice? I often get it once a month because I forgot to change the shipping address to my office. I&#8217;m one of the lucky ones: many people can&#8217;t have things shipped to them at work. Consultants are in a different location every week. Where is the delivery service that can drop off my package at my house between the hours of 6 and 10 PM?

Do you hear horror stories of trying to schedule a doctor&#8217;s appointment? Not only do they not answer the phone between 12 &#8211; 1 (because that&#8217;s their lunch break, coincidentally the only time some of us have a chance to make personal calls). Some of us have to take a half-day from work just to get there, sit and wait, meet with the doctor, and then go back to work. What about an oil change? Most of us go to our jobs somewhere between the hours of 7 AM &#8211; 7 PM. Oh, and you&#8217;re closed on Sundays? How convenient, that&#8217;s a day of rest&#8230;

Is there no demand for an &#8220;after hours&#8221; delivery service to make sure I don&#8217;t have to drive 10 miles out of my way to get that package I missed? Are there really no doctors willing to work evenings (after we all get off of work) so they can spend the day with their kids? And you&#8217;re telling me nobody at Jiffy Lube will work on evenings or Sundays? Let&#8217;s be real&#8230;

Services like \[UberCab\](http://ubercab.com) are headed in the right direction. They are geared toward people willing to spend a few extra bucks for regained time and service on our schedules.
