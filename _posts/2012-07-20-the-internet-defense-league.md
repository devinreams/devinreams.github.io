The Internet Defense League &#8220;is a loose coalition that shares a commitment to defending the Internet.&#8221; I decided to participate in broadcasting alerts on my site when the internet is &#8220;at risk&#8221; not because I think many visitors to a personal blog will be persuaded to act but because it seems like the right thing to do (beyond taking action when needed).
