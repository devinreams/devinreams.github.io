Again, it&#8217;s that time of the year. Nothing says love better than a bitter cold month of snow and fog. So, February aside, what does love mean to you? I&#8217;ve been asked the question once or twice before and I&#8217;ve taken a new approach. Here are some of my thoughts on what love *really* means&#8230;

*   LOL Oprah&#8217;s Very Entertaining
*   Liar, Osama Vacated Earlier
*   Labored Oarswomen Vacuum Everywhere
*   Lad, Oatmeal Varnishes Eggs
*   Lady, Oil&#8217;s Very Exciting
*   Lament! Opal&#8217;s Very Expensive

I may be wrong but I don&#8217;t think there is a right answer here. Can you come up with anything better?
