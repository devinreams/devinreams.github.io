I've always used Outlook to schedule my time and keep myself on task but I've found that 'Calendar' and 'Tasks' don't do much for me. The interfaces seem outdated and not as easy to mange as I'd like. This is why I actually designed my 'weekly schedule' in Excel. Although Outlook helps me look ahead, it doesn't help me look at my days very easily.

I also found that 'Tasks' don't do much for me. I don't know, but I decided to try out <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37 signals</a>' <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/">Ta-da lists</a>. The lists are great because I can create a bunch of different subjects (Classes, Work, Projects) and just drop tasks into it. I can quickly and easily arrange the order and then check them off when I'm done.

In addition, each list has a dot next to it which is a graphical representation of what needs to be done. A quick glance tells me I have a lot of magazines to read, a few books to finish and a bunch of tasks to do at work. On the other hand, I don't have as much course work yet. This serves as a nice reminder that even though X is easier, Y has a lot more than needs to be done. Also, I know which lists are priority so I can quickly look at those before anything else (instead of a mashed collection of tasks).

Going back to what I said earlier, I have all sorts of empty space on my calendar so when I find myself just chatting online I quickly reference my lists. I also made a list of my classes which I can then email to people or myself in case I forget. Lists are so good for me, I'm getting a ton done lately... I caught up on 4 magazines last night!
