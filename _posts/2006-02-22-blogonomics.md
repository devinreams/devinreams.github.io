Well, ask and you (well, I) shall receive. I&#8217;m now interning with [James Turner][1] of [One by One Media][2] and working my way towards [Blogonomics][3].Blogonomics is a 5 day blog conference in October where individuals like [Jeremy Wright][4], [Tris Hussey][5], [Darren Rowse][6] and [Robert Scoble][7] will be speaking (among many other people). This should be a great trip because it&#8217;s not merely a social opportunity, it&#8217;s a cruise! I didn&#8217;t even realize cruise ships had wireless. Personally, I&#8217;m looking forward to a day of (mini) golf and some great company.

Anyway, it seems pretty evident that anyone who has anything to do with blogs should be going to this event. You&#8217;ll obviously learn a lot and have a lot of great conversations. In addition, you can bring guests! Seems like a nice escape for folks because the conference is held during the <strike>boring</strike> down time on the ship.

With that said: I&#8217;m excited. Have you signed up yet? Apparently the slots are filling up pretty quickly. Plus, if you register now you&#8217;ll get a pretty decent discount. So&#8230; [go register!][8] Don&#8217;t forget to tell them devinreams.com sent you!
