&#8220;Why \_____ (popular company) should \____ (buy|destroy) \____ (other cool thing or company)&#8221; articles are so trite. They&#8217;re really:

&#8220;Why \_____ (my name) wants \_____ (edge case) in \____ (other cool thing or company) magically fixed with no economic sense by \____ (popular company)&#8221;

It&#8217;s like a really topical MadLib populated with keywords from Techmeme:

- &#8220;Why Apple should buy Skype&#8221;  
- &#8220;Why Google should buy Gowalla&#8221;

I click on these articles \*all the time\*. Those titles always look so appealing and savvy. They&#8217;re not.

They work the same way as &#8220;Top 10 (reasons|ways) \_____ (popular thing) (should|could) \____ (sexy verb or name or service)&#8221; articles.

- &#8220;Top 10 reasons Apple should buy Palm&#8221;  
- &#8220;Top 10 ways Facebook could rule the world&#8221;

I&#8217;m think I&#8217;m starting to figure this whole tech writing thing out.
