A few months ago Rachel and I planned a self-guided trip (four days, three nights) to Iceland. We considered flying direct from Denver but, since the flights were the same price, we stopped over in Boston and drove up to Freeport to visit with some friends. 

I published [our experiences and photos from Iceland](http://photos.devin.reams.me/iceland) using Exposure.so.
