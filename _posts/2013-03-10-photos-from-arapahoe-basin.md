We skied with friends at Arapahoe Basin today and had a great time. The snow was excellent (5 inches in 24 hours), no crowds nor lines, blue bird skies with sunny warm weather. It certainly was not a bad way to spend a Sunday. Click through to cosnow.com to see the [full gallery and recap from today][1].
