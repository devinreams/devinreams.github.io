[Gmail has added a feature that returns you to the previous screen \*immediately\* upon pressing send.][1] This means no more waiting until that message is \*actually\* sent and I love this. The idea is simple and is certainly pervasive in desktop applications: have your interface respond as if the action the user has taken has fully completed, no matter what else needs to happen behind the scenes. By adding the &#8220;Background Send&#8221; feature to Labs, the user has a faster experience and any delay is pushed out from the interface (which would potentially prevent further user interaction). Speaking from experience, this newly perceived fraction-of-a-second can be the difference between the &#8220;feel&#8221; that a web application is usable and on-par with a native application experience.
