**Quote of the Day:**

> &#8220;I was on the sixth floor of a hotel in New Delhi,&#8221; he recalled, &#8220;and when I looked out the window I could see for miles. How come? Because you do not have assured power in Delhi for elevators, so there are not many tall buildings.&#8221; No sensible investor would want to build a tall building in a city where the power could go out at any moment and you might have to walk up twenty flights of stairs. The result is more urban sprawl and an inefficient use of space.

From [The World is Flat][1], referring to why India&#8217;s economy, as a whole, has not taken off as much as it should (infastructure).
