NBC sucks. The worst thing they could have done is <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/17/nbc_nastygrams_youtu.html">send YouTube a C&D letter</a>. Viral marketing can be defined as:<em> Marketing phenomenon that facilitates and <strong>encourages</strong> people to pass along a marketing message</em>. Without that marketing it wouldn't have become popular. Which meant it wouldn't be on iTunes. Does anyone else realize<strong> the material from <span class="rss:item">Lonely Island (the guys who came up with it) was created under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons</a> license</span></strong><span class="rss:item">? I thought that was what made them so neat in the first place. NBC, you used to be cool...</span>
