I tend to write more 'asides' (they're the pink ones on here) than 'articles'. I like concise writing but it takes more thought. I know people who write long-winded paragraphs and essays in email, blogs, 9rules notes, and comments. Do your readers (message receivers) a favor: the more to the point, the better responses you'll get. I'm personally starting with this policy: <a href="http://five.sentenc.es/">five.sentenc.es</a>. Can't you be more brief?
