It appears as if Melody is onto something: <a href="http://okdork.com/melody/?p=16">aspartame is dangerous</a>... and it's in every pack of gum in my house! I, honest to goodness, wondered why sometimes I felt weird when I chewed a lot of gum (Orbit is my weapon of choice) in a day. I don't think I can quit all together but I'll certainly ween myself off it (I chew half pieces anyway).
