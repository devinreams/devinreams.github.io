When I earned the Boy Scout rank of Eagle I had to write a letter of my &#8216;Life Goals and Ambitions&#8217;. I rediscovered this letter the other day and it was a real eye-opener. I said a lot of interesting things that I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed. I realized today it&#8217;s important to revisit your future plans&#8230;

## Five years ago&#8230;

> My life ambitions include reaching the rank of Eagle Scout, graduating from high school with an International Baccalaureate degree, going to college and <span class="highlight">becoming an entrepreneur</span> &#8230; I want to study and obtain degrees and certifications in Computer Science. Of of my goals is to become a Cisco Certified Networks Associate. This certification will broaden my knowledge of computer networks and will provide a pathway to great job opportunities. I would also like to <span class="highlight">graduate from college with a Computer Science degree</span> &#8230; I would like to study in <span class="highlight">California</span> because I believe the technological environment makes it a great place to learn &#8230; I want to <span class="highlight">start my own technology business</span> with the knowledge I&#8217;ve obtained. I feel with the new knowledge I will have, and my current skills, I can start and run a technology company. As time goes on, <span class="highlight">I might change my mind</span> or I might have a different idea for the company I would start. But, I believe starting a business would provide me the opportunity to continue to challenge myself and exercise my leadership abilities.

That silly kid seemed to know what he was talking about. [I talked about the idea of long-term goals before.][1] I think it&#8217;s good to have direction and it&#8217;s obvious that I had one.

## Five years later&#8230;

I look back and yes, I became Eagle, I graduated with my diplomas and I graduated college with a degree. But, I didn&#8217;t get it in Computer Science. In fact, I wasn&#8217;t even in the engineering school. I began an Information Systems degree and I even changed that to Accounting.

So what happened? I realized I didn&#8217;t want to remain technical. I decided job opportunities aren&#8217;t all they&#8217;re cracked up to be. There&#8217;s more to it (like enjoying what you do). I also saw what happened to technology companies in California. Times change, so could I.

Did I fail at reaching my goals? I wouldn&#8217;t look at it that way. I may not be a CCNA and I may not have my own business. But, I feel like I&#8217;m still on the right path. I&#8217;m still learning and I&#8217;m still gaining leadership experience.

## Evaluate your goals

It&#8217;s important to see where you think you&#8217;re headed. At this point it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m on a road trip. I&#8217;m starting in Boston and I know I want to be on the West coast. I start driving and I hit a fork. At that point, I&#8217;ll I decide what to do. I have no map, just a sense of direction. Maybe I&#8217;ll detour down to New Orleans. Perhaps I&#8217;ll stop in Kansas for a bit. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t even know which state I&#8217;m aiming for. I&#8217;m simply headed in the general direction&#8230;

Do I still want to be a technology entrepreneur? I don&#8217;t know. I think I&#8217;ll sit down and write up some ideas of what I hope to do in a few years.

It&#8217;ll be fun to look back&#8230; again.
