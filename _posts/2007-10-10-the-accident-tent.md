I will buy a burrito to anyone who helps me build &#8220;The Accident Tent.&#8221; Tow trucks and local and highway law enforcement will carry them in the trunk. As soon as they arrive at an accident and move it out of traffic they pop out this all-encompassing tent surrounding everything and everyone so that it a) gives the victims some privacy and b) keeps people from looking, stopping, staring, wondering, etc. I imagine it saying &#8220;keep driving, morons!&#8221; across the side.
