Nicholas Cage's character, Yuri, is <em>the</em> Lord of War. He rubs shoulders with the worst people in the world and supplies them with, as he puts it, a means to defend themselves. This movie exposes you to the most fascinating ... facts or fiction?  ... of arms dealing. I believe theres many truths to it, and the drama itself is very interesting.

There were a number of memorable quotes from the movie that I'd like to share:
<blockquote>"Governments are changed more often by bullets than votes."

"After the Cold War, the AK-47 became Russia's biggest export. After that came vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists."</blockquote>
I could go on but the movie is certainly worth watching. There's a touch of humor <em>and</em> history, how could you not like it? It's harsh, though. Reality sometimes is. You'll see bloodshed; much of it is actually occuring as you read this (all seven of you).

If I were to give this a rating I'd say 9/10. IMDB users rated it a 7.5 (which is high). Did anyone else like it as much as I did? Maybe I found it favorable becuase it gave me a chance to test out my new electric blanket...
