Sick of getting credit offers that you never initiated? I get at least 3 credit-card offers each week. There&#8217;s an easy way to stop these:

<div align="center">
  <strong>1-888-5OPTOUT or <a href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t">OptOutPrescreen.com</a></strong>
</div>

I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed this offer was available to me if it weren&#8217;t for [this new regulation][1] requiring a statement in &#8220;12-point type &#8211; on the first page of the offer&#8221; letting me know I can stop unsolicited offers. You have the option of having your information removed for 5 years or permanently (you must mail back a form). If you&#8217;re wary of giving up your information you can read [this page from the FTC][2].

The FTC also points to [this website used for deleting yourself from direct marketing mailing lists][3].

So&#8230; what are you waiting for?
