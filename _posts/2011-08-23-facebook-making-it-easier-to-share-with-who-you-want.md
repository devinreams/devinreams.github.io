New changes to Facebook are being rolled out to control who can see your content. As with previous attempts, this gives a lot more control that people keep asking for. But, makes it much more confusing and a little harder to manage. Good news though: people (mostly female) across Facebook are rejoicing over one of the most requested features (anecdotal): the ability to pre-approve photos you&#8217;re tagged in.
