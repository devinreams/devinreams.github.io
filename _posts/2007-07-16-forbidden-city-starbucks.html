<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6898629.stm">The Starbucks in the Forbidden City (China) was closed.</a> I think I'm going to make myself a t-shirt and try to sell it. "I went to the Forbidden City and all I got was this lousy latte." But seriously, I went to that Starbucks and now nobody else will be able to. Crazy.
