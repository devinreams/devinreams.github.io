If you&#8217;ve not seen: [Aereo][1] is a new startup backed by Barry Diller to free the television airwaves and put them online. In short: they create a farm of television antennas, put them online, and then allow you to watch your broadcast television online.

It&#8217;s currently running in New York and has already met some legal challenges (incumbents certainly don&#8217;t like threats). [Sign up online][2] to get updates when it arrives in your city.
