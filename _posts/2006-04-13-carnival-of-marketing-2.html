I apologize for my absence. I was gone for 4 days, had work, school (midterm, presentation), and tonight I had a concert. In short, I've been oh-so-busy lately.

But that's not why I'm writing. I'm here to remind everyone that the <a href="http://okdork.com/grand-opening-carnival-of-marketing/">Carnival of Marketing</a> will be hosted by yours truly next week. At first, I didn't even understand what a Carnival was but it's quite simple: write something insightful, new, and/or interesting and I will gladly spotlight your post right here. The point is, I host the carnival and you're one of the rides. People stop by here because they know I've collected the best rides the internet has to offer.
For example, a few weeks ago I wrote <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/02/18/market-to-college-students/">Market to College Students</a>. I was in the Carnival and I received a bunch of traffic/subscribers.

So, if you have something you'd like for me to mention just shoot me an email (devin@devinreams.com). It's really that simple. I look forward to the submissions!
