From Joe over at [Dappered on &#8220;luxury&#8221;][1]:

> It doesn’t matter if your outfit cost $7,500 or $75. It doesn’t matter if you’re hopping a private jet to Marseille or riding your bike to the park down the street. That Pinot Grigio can cost $500, or it can cost $6.50. What’s key is that you’re taking the time to actually enjoy life&#8230; 

It&#8217;s a quick and smart read. I&#8217;m starting my list&#8230;
