Like Alex, I&#8217;ve had a [post on NDAs][1] ready to draft up any day now. But many people have said it better than I could: NDAs are, in most cases, unnecessary; as if I had the time or energy to implement your idea, assuming it&#8217;s even a good one. As with [RFPs][2], NDAs are often a good litmus test: some of the best projects and ideas come without one.
