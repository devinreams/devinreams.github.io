Our plan was to have a little "adventure" and move away from Denver for a little while. We planned a trip to Maine to coincide with [The Monktoberfest](http://monktoberfest.com/), my must-attend conference for the last four years straight. Instead of flying, this time we'd pack up the car with whatever we could grab and stay in Portland for a while.

The first day, Tuesday, was tough. We started at 4 AM and made it to Chicago around 9 PM.

We took Wednesday off (of driving) to poke around and enjoy my birthday.

Thursday we drove all day to Niagara Falls and made it just before the sun set.

We made it through New York by lunch on Friday. By 6 PM we made it through Vermont, past New Hampshire and were parked at our camp site in Maine.

It was a lot of driving but also a lot of country I had never seen before. Be sure to check out [my photos driving east to Maine](http://photos.devin.reams.me/driving-to-maine) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co/).
