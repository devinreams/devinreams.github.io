Do you feel like you deserve a little better? Are you not being challenged enough? Well, then perhaps it&#8217;s time to move on. Maybe a new boss, different company, perhaps even a new career. Whatever it may be, you know you should change jobs when&#8230;

1.  **You take the longer way to the bathroom.** You know, past the windows. So you can see the outside world.
2.  **You get excited when the fire-alarm goes off.** Either everything is going up in flames or you just earned a 15 minute paid break.
3.  **You get coffee twelve times before noon.** Hey, the more walking, the less work. And the more coffee, the more bathroom breaks.
4.  **You feel accomplished when you take home office supplies.** Especially by accident. What an awesome surprise. A free pen!
5.  **You go to lunch at 2:00pm.** Not because you&#8217;re working too hard but because you know when you get back you&#8217;ve only got an hour or so until quitting time.
6.  **You start parking further and further away.** &#8220;Well, I made it to the office parking lot by 8:00, but the walk put me in my chair at 8:09. I think that means I get to leave 10 minutes early, too.&#8221;
7.  **You check your co-workers&#8217; schedules to avoid confrontation.** &#8220;It looks like my boss has a meeting from 4 to 5&#8230; I bet I could slide out at 4:30.&#8221;
8.  **Mandatory time off sounds good.** Who needs to get paid? At least you&#8217;re not at work!
9.  **You use Outlook&#8217;s &#8216;Do not deliver before&#8217; option.** Nothing says &#8216;good employee&#8217; when you spend Friday afternoon scheduling a few emails to go out on late Saturday night.
10. **You make lists about changing jobs&#8230;** at work.
