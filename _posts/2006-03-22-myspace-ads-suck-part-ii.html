If you haven't noticed, I <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/03/05/myspace-comments-suck/#comments">don't</a> <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/03/05/ugly-works/#respond">like</a> MySpace very much (read <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/02/08/myspace-ads-suck/">MySpace Ads Suck</a>). Just like I don't like AIM (devinhatesaim is really my screenname). To me, AIM is to MySpace as Google Talk is to Facebook. Anyway, MySpace's big ugly website and ads still suck.

Apparently those terrible wastes of space --yes, the ads that mix and blend in with the content-- are apparently one of the main reasons companies are leery of advertising on MySpace. Don't believe me? Read <a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&s=41210&Nid=19210&p=330482">this page</a> and this quote:
<blockquote>"We're being cautious because there's a blurring between advertising and content, and the content does rub off on your brand."

-Dawn Hudson, president and CEO of Pepsi-Cola North America</blockquote>
It's hard always being right...
