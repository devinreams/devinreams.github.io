I ran into the weirdest thing the other day and I want to share my experience in the hopes it will help someone else. I drive to school and listen to music with a Griffin iTrip. So, I got to school, disconnected the iTrip and went to class. I came back to the car, hooked up the iTrip and nothing. The red light was on as if it were broadcasting but it definitely wasn&#8217;t. I checked every radio station: nothing. I came home and decided to re-load the &#8216;station&#8217; which luckily worked. Just make sure that you select the station you want to play, and hit pause/play once it starts blinking rapidly. After the fact I found [this article from Griffin][1]. I just thought it to be pretty weird to suddenly &#8216;forget&#8217; how to broadcast. Oh well!
