This weekend Rachel and I visited Salt Lake City, Utah to celebrate her grandmother's birthday and see family from her mother's side.

We were able to spend a few hours in downtown Salt Lake City and see the LDS Temple Square area. I learned a bit more about the history and was fascinated by seeing the "mecca" of the mormon church.

I've posted [photos from our visit to Salt Lake](http://photos.devin.reams.me/visiting-salt-lake-city) over at [Exposure.so](http://exposure.so/).
