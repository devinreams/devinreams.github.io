<p class="MsoNormal">I?ve been reading a bunch on stress (given I?m a <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/02/05/workaholics/">workaholic</a>) and I?ve done some thinking: I rarely ever feel stressed so I never have to deal with it. I?ve never understood why this is, though. Maybe I?m stress proof, maybe it?s how I live my life? My question to you is:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>How do <em>you</em> deal with stress?</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do you ever lock yourself in the library for days at a time? Do you try to work harder and faster on the task at-hand? Do you work on the easier task first? Do you stop and take deep breaths? Do you tap your pen or move your leg up and down thousands of times a second? Do you tell yourself that the situation isn?t as bad as it seems? Do you ?retreat? and ignore everything else going on?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you find yourself doing any of these things you may want to read more about the different ways to approach stress.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Reactive: </strong>Reactive approaches are the easiest. It?s as simple as responding to stress and trying to cope with it once it arises. This includes stopping and taking a deep breath or quickly tapping your pen and even writing faster. Sure, reactive equals ?immediate? but is limited to the short-term.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Proactive: </strong>Being proactive is about developing resiliency strategies: how you spring back to normalcy after being stretched in a hundred directions. This includes conditioning yourself to deal with stress (healthy diet, exercise, relaxation) and even reshaping your personality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Enactive:</strong> Being enactive means creating an environment that eliminates stressors. This is the hardest approach because it takes a lot of work and a lot of time. Though, the benefits are <strong>permanent</strong>. For many their strategies include time management and even redesigning the way they approach work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the coming days I?ll address my personal strategies but, once again, I submit to you:</p>
