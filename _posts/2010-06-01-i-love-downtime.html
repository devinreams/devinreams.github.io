<p>Nothing frustrates people more than a website going down at the same time they're in need of it's services. Just look to twitter when <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a> or <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> experience unavailability; people lose their cool. Twitter was down so much that it accidentally popularized their growing pains via the fail whale.</p>&#13;
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l3c899OXjn1qzt8mx.png" /></p>&#13;
<p>I look at downtime a little differently, though. When I see all the hundreds of millions of <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2010/02/19/wp-com-downtime-summary/">WordPress.com blogs disappear for two hours</a>, I think to myself "let's see how they handle this." I breathe a sigh of relief when I read that WordPress.com was able to recover from a catastrophic failure costing millions of lost pageviews (read: revenue). In other words, there's a service provider that can come back from downtime and I have no questions about whether they can handle a similar incident in the future.</p>&#13;
<p>Performing regular backups is not enough. When <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/01/magnolia-suffer/">magnolia admitted to not having backups</a> of it's users bookmarks, people were rightfully upset. But, even if they had been saved, would there have been a there a process in place to restore the data? Would service be restored in a timely manner? Even more, has the data ever been tested for recoverability or just thrown on a disk or into the cloud assuming everything is all set in case of emergency?</p>&#13;
<p>When I see <a href="http://pinboard.in">pinboard</a>, my favorite bookmarking service, <a href="http://pinboard.in/blog/125/">take a spill twice in two weeks</a> I rest peacefully. I go to sleep knowing that Maciej has a hot backup server that he can quickly switch to and continue running with just a few minutes of downtime. I love that. No data will be lost, just a hiccup in the day. One hiccup that, if it were to happen yet again, could easily be handled.</p>&#13;
<p>Of course, my data is portable in many of these cases. I can extract it at any time and back it up however I choose. There's no reason to rely on my service provider. But, that's really not the point of portability. Even though there may be no service agreement, you're using a service with some (perhaps incorrect) assumptions that it will always be there and always work. Perhaps that's an issue with free services, they need not provide any guarantee.</p>&#13;
<p>But even the services we pay heavily for: our web hosts, the photo storage sites, the hosted project management tools. Some of these sites and services have gone on untested and unproven. I'm a little more wary of what might happen if something unforeseen happens to them. Could <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/2008/01/12/downtime-notice/">flickr recover from an issue</a> and maintain my priceless photos and memories. Could my business still operate if <a href="http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2007/11/downtime-explan.html">37signals went down</a>? Am I paying them for any guarantee of restored service? I honestly don't know. Even web hosts store backups, but that snapshot may have included the virus that originally took your site down... that's no help.</p>&#13;
<p>I love downtime because it shows me how a provider will handle an adverse situation both in and out of their control.</p>
