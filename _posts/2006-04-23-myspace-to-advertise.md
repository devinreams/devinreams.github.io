[Interesting article on how MySpace is thinking about&#8230; gasp&#8230; making money through advertising.][1] Good thought! Their revolutionary thinking has essentially taken what Facebook has already done&#8230; and made it uglier&#8230; probably with music playing in the background: *&#8220;To expand ad sales &#8230; [MySpace] plans to [turn] advertisers into members of the MySpace community, with their own profiles, like the teenagers&#8217; ? so that the young people who often spend hours each day on MySpace can become &#8220;friends&#8221; with movies, cellphone companies and even deodorants. Young people can link to the profiles set up for these goods and services, as they would to real friends, and these commercial &#8220;friends&#8221; can even send them messages ? ads, really&#8230;.&#8221;* Yeah, that&#8217;ll fly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to add my deodorant to my friend list!&#8221; Jackasses.
