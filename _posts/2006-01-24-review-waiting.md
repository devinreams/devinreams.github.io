Odds are you are, or know someone who is in the restaurant business. From what I&#8217;ve been told this movie exposes many of the finer details to handling other people&#8217;s food.

Oh, wait, it&#8217;s not just some dumb movie about some disgruntled waiters. There are &#8216;guy&#8217; jokes left and right. Personally, I&#8217;m surprised with what they can get away with these days. In addition, the main character&#8217;s struggle is with deciding on whether or not sleeping with the 17-year old hostess is moral (not to mention legal) or not. Classy, to say the least. That&#8217;s okay though, Ryan Renolds is the coolest actor around (Van Wilder, anyone?).

Being a male, aged 16-25, I found many parts of this movie to be extremely humerous. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;d have a girl come watch with me, that&#8217;s for sure. Though, that doesn&#8217;t mean many wouldn&#8217;t enjoy it.

In any case, the inside look at what it&#8217;s really like to &#8216;wait&#8217; tables is very funny. I&#8217;d recommed it to any guys who share similar humor tastes (Family Guy, Simpsons, Van Wilder). I&#8217;d have to give &#8216;Waiting&#8217; a 5/10; it&#8217;s disgusting, immature, but pretty darned entertaining&#8230;
