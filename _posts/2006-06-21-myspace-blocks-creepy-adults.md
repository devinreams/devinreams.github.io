MySpace is stupid as hell: &#8220;MySpace users who are 18 or over could no longer request to be on a 14- or 15-year-old&#8217;s friends&#8217; list&#8221; ([Link][1]). Oh yeah, all those creepy adults can only see partial profiles, now. Mission accomplished, guys. Are you kidding me?! On a website where people are aged 69, 123, 184, and 92 how the fuck was a users &#8216;age&#8217; determined as the best deterrent? Go look at [my profile][2], I&#8217;m suddenly a 14-year old in 30 seconds.
