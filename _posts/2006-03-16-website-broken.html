If you're reading this you're subscribed to my feed and not reading from my website. My provider is very broken and I'm very not happy. Then again, I don't pay anything for it. Sigh. Anyone have any ideas? I was more upset about my email, though. If anything was sent in the last 5 days and I haven't responded please re-send.
