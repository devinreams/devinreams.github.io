I feel like the 3984734th person to link to Guy in the last week and a half. Honestly, everything he writes is worth it?s? bytes? ? in gold. <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/hindsights.html">I wish I had heard this speech when I graduated high school</a>. I?m off to do some thinking? perhaps I should do some traveling soon. I believe that was <a href="http://www.bradjasper.com/">Brad?s</a> latest revelation? hmmm.
