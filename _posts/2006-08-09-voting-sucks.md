    I can&#8217;t help but get a little political for a minute. I was discussing the primaries with a friend today. This individual was spending a bunch of time researching different candidates, peering deep into their websites and analyzing their plans and how they fit this person&#8217;s own beliefs, values, etc. The act, although commendable, is fruitless.

    My main problem at that point in the conversation was the fact that we&#8217;re going to base decisions on information on a candidates website. Ideas are awesome. Everyone has them. Heck, anyone can have a plan too because, lets be honest, a plan is simply a bunch of ideas organized by priority and/or time. But to then trust this people and simply assume (or extrapolate) the notion that they&#8217;ll then execute these ideas&#8230; well, that&#8217;s just silly.

    For starters, politicians have plenty of time to come up with &#8216;ideas&#8217; and &#8216;plans&#8217; before they&#8217;re elected. They don&#8217;t have too many responsibilities to take up their free time so they spend it brainstorming (and campaigning for a little bit, sure). While this may or may not be true I can picture a guy in a suit sitting at home doodling on his notepad with a picture of melting ice caps and a big fan trying to keep them cool. Then there are those in congress that run for re-election and win it something like 94% of the time. Incumbency is going to kill this country for one simple reason: these people are already politicians and don&#8217;t have time to sit around and doodle. Instead they have to go to meetings, lunches, and play golf with other politicians. The brainstorming process halts once you&#8217;re sworn in. If there&#8217;s no time for doodling do you believe for a second there&#8217;d be any room for &#8216;executing&#8217; those &#8216;ideas&#8217; from earlier? I rest my case&#8230;

    Once in a blue moon you&#8217;ll find someone who really cares to do their job. The only problem being: they&#8217;re a freaking nut case. The only people who want to get out there and make changes are those who shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to make changes in the first place (or children for that matter). As Jon Stewart put it: the country ends up being run by extremeists because moderates have shit to do. Seriously, congress is full of old, incompentent morons. Remember the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes">series of tubes</a>? As an employee of <a href="http://www.level3.com/">the backbone</a> of the internet, nothing scares me more than the government right now.

    Spot on. In fact, I&#8217;d get into politics if it weren&#8217;t so damned.. well, political.

    Why vote?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    So at this point I clearly lack confidence in anyone or anything trying to get my vote. It&#8217;s going to take a lot to convince me that you&#8217;re not too busy or a passionate moron (or unethical, or an adulterer, or any other stereotype). But wait, it&#8217;s my duty to vote, right? I mean, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been told since elementary school government class. I guess I don&#8217;t appreciate the argument that I need to vote simply because people in Africa can&#8217;t. Any kid who&#8217;s been told to finish their dinner because kids in China are starving know where I&#8217;m coming from here. As a kid the &#8220;you need to vote&#8221; lecture ranks up there with &#8220;sharing is good&#8221;, you don&#8217;t really question it&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Interestingly enough I can name one good reason to not vote: you have <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2005/11/04/why-vote/">no economic interest</a>. At least, that&#8217;s what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levitt">Steven Levitt</a> (<a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a>) serves up.

      Why would an economist be embarrassed to be seen at the voting booth? Because voting exacts a cost &#8211; in time, effort, lost productivity &#8211; with no discernible payoff except perhaps some vague sense of having done your &#8220;civic duty.&#8221; As the economist Patricia Funk wrote in a recent paper, &#8220;A rational individual should abstain from voting.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/magazine/06freak.html?ex=1155268800&#038;en=c67410c5a6362e83&#038;ei=5070">NYTimes</a>)

    Fair enough. I&#8217;ve got another good reason: there&#8217;s no way you can really be informed enough to make a good decision. I don&#8217;t think any of us really understand all the issues enough to have an opinion one way or another (to make the best decision). This is why Scott calls himself a <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/03/am_i_a_libertar.html">Ignorantselfishertarian</a>. Then again, what are the most recent and pressing issues we need to tackle? The importance of same-sex marriage and it&#8217;s implications on society? Flag burning? Do I really need to spend time waiting in line to elect someone to vote on this crap?

    I really like Scott Adams&#8217; <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/05/pragmatic_party.html">Pragmatic Party</a>. I think the more realistic solution, though, is to wait a few more years for the &#8216;old guard&#8217; to phase itself out of elected positions (in Castro fashion). Just imagine, in 10-20 years we&#8217;ll be <a href="http://www.ocala.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060806/OPINION/208060336/1030/OPINION01">dancing in the streets</a>&#8230;
