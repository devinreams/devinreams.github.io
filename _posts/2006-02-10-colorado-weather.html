I woke up yesterday and it was 50 degrees. This whole week's average has has been barely more than 60. When I wake up it's typically the coldest part of the day (around 10-20 degrees). But 50 degrees at 7:00 in the morning?! Noon rolled around and the clouds settled, wind raced down the hills... it started to get downright nasty! Clear blue sky by 2:00p. Then, I look out my window around 11:00p to find three inches of snow. The temperature is now 18. This is <strong>a typical day</strong> in Colorado...
