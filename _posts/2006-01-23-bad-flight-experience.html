The other day I talked about <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/01/22/good-and-bad-news/#comments">my bad flight experience</a>, but I think as far as 'storyworthiness' is concerned, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/heatherleigh/archive/2006/01/23/516282.aspx">Heather's wins by a mile</a>. Not that it's a good thing... but it certainly is an interesting coincidence. But seriously... how weird is that story?!
