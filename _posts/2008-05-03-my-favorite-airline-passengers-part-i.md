I&#8217;ve done a bunch of flying in the last few months (for work and training). I still get a little excited every time I fly. Airports have so many people and airplanes have so many people in a small spot. This means excellent people watching. I&#8217;ve come up with some of my favorite passenger profiles:

*   **Can&#8217;t fit anything in the over-head bin:** Why does it take 30 minutes to get 100 people on a small commuter plane? Because of this guy. Maybe if you owned a less awkwardly shaped bag you wouldn&#8217;t struggle to find a bin that a L-shaped opening. Seriously, you weren&#8217;t that good at tetris, why do you think you can manage this bin? Go find another one and let me guy by!
*   **Wonders why there isn&#8217;t a blanket:** Why are you making a big deal? You paid $400+ for this seat and your happiness is hinging on a pillow / blanket. Those things are gross, expensive, and if it&#8217;s such a necessity&#8211;why don&#8217;t you pack one? Stop bothering the flight attendant and making me listen to you.
*   **Slept through beverage service:** If you can&#8217;t stay awake for the 20 minute boarding process, 5 minute taxing and 15 minute ascent before beverage service why do you deserve a cup of Sprite? Are you really that tired? Was there nothing you could&#8217;ve done to pass the few minutes before a drink would come around? Apparently so because now you and the seven other lazy passengers are going to make the attendant go back and forth between the galley. That&#8217;s 14 trips he or she didn&#8217;t need to do.
*   **The seatbelt sign doesn&#8217;t apply to me:** The plane touched the ground, seatbelt off! Dude, you&#8217;re in row 24&#8211;you won&#8217;t be grabbing your bag for at least 12 more minutes: sit down! Oh and why did you think it was cool to get up and go to the bathroom whenever you wanted? The light is on because it&#8217;s not safe, dummy. I&#8217;m glad they called you out over the intercom, you self-centered tool.

Please tell me you fit one of these profiles because you make my flights go so much faster! And if you&#8217;re not, please tell me you find as much pleasure in these people as I do.
