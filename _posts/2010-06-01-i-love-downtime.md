Nothing frustrates people more than a website going down at the same time they&#8217;re in need of it&#8217;s services. Just look to twitter when [Media Temple][1] or [Gmail][2] experience unavailability; people lose their cool. Twitter was down so much that it accidentally popularized their growing pains via the fail whale.

I look at downtime a little differently, though. When I see all the hundreds of millions of [WordPress.com blogs disappear for two hours][4], I think to myself &#8220;let&#8217;s see how they handle this.&#8221; I breathe a sigh of relief when I read that WordPress.com was able to recover from a catastrophic failure costing millions of lost pageviews (read: revenue). In other words, there&#8217;s a service provider that can come back from downtime and I have no questions about whether they can handle a similar incident in the future.

&#13;

Performing regular backups is not enough. When [magnolia admitted to not having backups][5] of it&#8217;s users bookmarks, people were rightfully upset. But, even if they had been saved, would there have been a there a process in place to restore the data? Would service be restored in a timely manner? Even more, has the data ever been tested for recoverability or just thrown on a disk or into the cloud assuming everything is all set in case of emergency?

&#13;

When I see [pinboard][6], my favorite bookmarking service, [take a spill twice in two weeks][7] I rest peacefully. I go to sleep knowing that Maciej has a hot backup server that he can quickly switch to and continue running with just a few minutes of downtime. I love that. No data will be lost, just a hiccup in the day. One hiccup that, if it were to happen yet again, could easily be handled.

&#13;

Of course, my data is portable in many of these cases. I can extract it at any time and back it up however I choose. There&#8217;s no reason to rely on my service provider. But, that&#8217;s really not the point of portability. Even though there may be no service agreement, you&#8217;re using a service with some (perhaps incorrect) assumptions that it will always be there and always work. Perhaps that&#8217;s an issue with free services, they need not provide any guarantee.

&#13;

But even the services we pay heavily for: our web hosts, the photo storage sites, the hosted project management tools. Some of these sites and services have gone on untested and unproven. I&#8217;m a little more wary of what might happen if something unforeseen happens to them. Could [flickr recover from an issue][8] and maintain my priceless photos and memories. Could my business still operate if [37signals went down][9]? Am I paying them for any guarantee of restored service? I honestly don&#8217;t know. Even web hosts store backups, but that snapshot may have included the virus that originally took your site down&#8230; that&#8217;s no help.

&#13;

I love downtime because it shows me how a provider will handle an adverse situation both in and out of their control.
