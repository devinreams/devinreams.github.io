The [Daily Telegraph][1] weighs in on Alan de Botton&#8217;s philosophical &#8220;commandments&#8221; for atheists:

> Politeness he equates with tolerance for the &#8220;otherness&#8221; of people whose views do not chime with our own. As for self-awareness: &#8220;To know oneself is to try not to blame others for one&#8217;s troubles and moods; to have a sense of what&#8217;s going on inside oneself, and what actually belongs in the world,&#8221; he says. 

Arguably, these are all great virtues for everyone, not just atheists, to strive for.

1.  Resilience: Keeping going even when things are looking dark.
2.  Empathy: The capacity to connect imaginatively with the sufferings and unique experiences of another person.
3.  Patience: We should grow calmer and more forgiving by being more realistic about how things actually happen.
4.  Sacrifice: We won&#8217;t ever manage to raise a family, love someone else or save the planet if we don&#8217;t keep up with the art of sacrifice.
5.  Politeness: Politeness is closely linked to tolerance, -the capacity to live alongside people whom one will never agree with, but at the same time, cannot avoid.
6.  Humour: Like anger, humour springs from disappointment, but it is disappointment optimally channelled.
7.  Self-awareness: To know oneself is to try not to blame others for one&#8217;s troubles and moods; to have a sense of what&#8217;s going on inside oneself, and what actually belongs to the world.
8.  Forgiveness: It&#8217;s recognising that living with others is not possible without excusing errors.
9.  Hope: Pessimism is not necessarily deep, nor optimism shallow.
10. Confidence: Confidence is not arrogance &#8211; rather, it is based on a constant awareness of how short life is and how little we will ultimately lose from risking everything.
