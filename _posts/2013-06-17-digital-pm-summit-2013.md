I&#8217;m excited to attend the upcoming [Digital PM Summit][1], produced by the smart guys at Happy Cog (Greg Hoy and Greg Storey) for digital project managers. I&#8217;ve seen presentations by and met a number of Happy Cog folks at conferences like SXSW and it&#8217;s clear they do great work.

The [speaker line-up][2] suggests I will walk away with plenty to think about and am excited to chat with other like-minded folks…
