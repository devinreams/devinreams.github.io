[Community Next][1] is bridging Silicon Valley to the land of silicone with **The Next Generation of Media and the Web** happening Saturday, March 29 in West Hollywood. You may remember I&#8217;ve been pretty involved with Community Next and this one is going to be a neat twist on the original conferences: it&#8217;s not in the Bay, it&#8217;s in LA!

**Quick overview:**

*   Learn how the web is changing and how to stay ahead of the curve
*   Connect with people from top online companies
*   Connect with funny/smart/cool/interesting people
*   **FREE OPEN BAR** party, hosted by Twiistup on Friday night, March 28
*   FREE Redbull, food and drinks to keep you going at the conference

Speakers include Robert Scoble (scobleizer.com/Fast Company), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit, Founder), Veronica Belmont (Mahalo Daily) and more ([click here for full list of speakers][2]).

**Special 10% discount for all of my friends**: sign up at <http://nextmedia.eventbrite.com/?discount=sweetdreams>.

I&#8217;ll be there, kicking it in Hollywood. Let me know if you&#8217;ll be around, too.
