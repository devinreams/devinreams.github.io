	I love the <a href="http://www.discoverychannel.com/">Discovery Channel</a>. Why? It's the only "cable" channel we get in our "basic cable" package. Apparently that package means local programming + spanish channels + paid programming + Discovery Channel. Now that you understand why I'm a self-declared expert on the aforementioned channel, read on to learn more about the diverse programming found on Discovery...

	Lets play a matching game! Try to match the description with the show:


	<ol>
		<li><strong>Freezing, Wet Jobs</strong> - Learn how hard it is to fish in the Bearing Sea (hint: you get cold and wet). </li>
		<li><strong>Explosive Jobs</strong> - Explore the excitement behind blowing something up four different ways every week.</li>
	<li><strong>Robber Jobs</strong> - Learn how easy it is to break into people's houses and what to do to secure your own.</li>
		<li><strong>Survival Jobs</strong> - Understand how much it would suck if you were stranded, deserted, or lost just about anywhere but downtown.</li>
		<li><strong>Dirty Jobs</strong> - Learn about the occupations you intentionally try not to learn about.</li>
		<li><strong>Psuedo-Science Jobs</strong> - See how science can look cool while learning absolutely nothing.</li>
		<li><strong>Medical Jobs</strong> - A first-hand look at how gross it is to operate on people.</li>
		<li><strong>Painful Jobs</strong> - Get your adrenaline up watching other people bike, ski, and fall from places you'd never visit.</li>
		<li><strong>Construction Jobs</strong> - Learn how just about every complicated structure in the world is made and how it never goes right.</li>
		<li><strong>Jobs</strong> - If a job hasn't been explored in the above shows its explained here. Actually, there's lots of overlap.</li>
	</ol>

	<ul>
	<li>A. Extreme Engineering</li>
	<li>B. It Takes A Thief</li>
	<li>C. Man vs Wild</li>
	<li>D. MythBusters</li>
	<li>E. Dirty Jobs</li>
	<li>F. FutureWeapons</li>
	<li>G. Surgery Saved My Life</li>
	<li>H. Deadliest Catch</li>
	<li>I. How It's Made</li>
	<li>J. Stunt Junkies</li>
	</ul>

	There you have it. Every show on Discovery can be referred to as _____ Jobs. Did you figure out my clever game? Here are the answers (highlight to see them): <u>[ <font color="#ffffff">H, F, B, C, E, D, G, J, A, I</font>]</u>
