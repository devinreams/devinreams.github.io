I&#8217;m starting to hate this [Google-China attack fest][1], lately. Do people forget Google is a company? Do people realize that China is huge? &#8216;Evil&#8217; is such a relative term, just because *you* don&#8217;t like something doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s evil. In addition, why do we have double standards? MSN and Yahoo were first to comply and go to China. Please realize that competition is sometimes about standing up to the bad guys (DOJ) and other times its doing what&#8217;s best for the company and its users (China). Why on earth does Google warrant crap like [this logo changer][2]? I wonder what we&#8217;ll find to be &#8216;evil&#8217; next week&#8230;
