Ever since SXSW I've rethought a lot of what it is I'm doing, what my priorities are, etc. I've also noticed that every night I get home from work and I'm tired. Crazy huh? I also get hungry at lunch time.

But seriously, I hate getting home and not feeling motivated to do anything else. So, I've gone back to something I perfected in college: <a href="http://mindaverse.com/2006/02/21/biphasic-sleep-faq/">napping</a>.

At the time, biphasic and polyphasic sleep were being (re)discovered online. I stopped taking naps after I started my big-boy job out of college. But now, I realize, it'd be great to take a nap and start a 'second day' every night.

So my schedule is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>08:00 AM - Wake up, go to work, etc.</li>
	<li>06:00 PM - Leave work, have dinner, etc.</li>
	<li>08:00 PM - Sleep</li>
	<li>11:00 PM - Wake up, start 'second day' (read, watch movies, blog, etc.)</li>
	<li>05:00 AM - Go to sleep</li>
</ul>

My body is, luckily, still used to the 80-90 minute sleep cycles so I can get away with two chunks of 3 hours and feel energized all day.

Two days in and I've hit the ground running. I'm pretty stoked. If you have any questions and want to try biphasic sleep / naps just leave a comment.
