If you missed it, Denver was hit by a nice little blizzard on Wednesday. My house had over 20 inches of accumulation. Other places around the state had four feet. I&#8217;m just glad the power stayed on- I got a lot accomplished as far as Playstation 2 games is concerned. But, after a few hours in the house it&#8217;s pretty fun to go outside. Here&#8217;s a few ways we kept ourselves occupied.

## Shovel snow

Most cities require your sidewalks to be cleared within 24 hours of snow. Hahahaha, sucker. If you don&#8217;t have a HOA that hires people like mine does, well, see you outside! We don&#8217;t even own a snow shovel, we cleared snow from the front of our driveway with a recycling bin.

## Take lots of pictures

In fifty years your grandkids will want to know how much snow &#8220;a lot&#8221; *really* was. Take pictures of yourself skiing to the grocery store because, come on, nobody would believe that shit. Even if it *was* uphill both ways. [Here&#8217;s my collection][1].

## Watch people get stuck

My family lives at the bottom of a huge hill which means endless hours of entertainment as people slide back down the hill and get stuck in a drift. Two feet of accumulation is not as easy to drive in as it sounds.

## Help people get unstuck

My brother made quite a bit in tips helping dig people out and push them free. Just because you can&#8217;t get to work doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t bring in some cash. Plus, it&#8217;s a good workout.

## Make things out of snow

Sure, it seems obvious but what better thing to do than build snowmen, snow forts, etc. This also makes for a good work out. If you&#8217;re in college you can take the more popular &#8216;snow phallus&#8217; route. There&#8217;s nothing like building a giant obelisk in the church parking lot to offend the neighborhood.

## Sled and ski

The Denver Mayor took a fun idea from NYC: sled day at city parks. The Parks would serve up hot chocolate and people would go sledding. Personally, I&#8217;m a fan of working on my 360 by building a [big snow jump][2]. Nothing says fun like minor concussions.

But, if you can&#8217;t even get out then you can do all those fun things around the house. Clean the bathroom, organize your closet, organize your music collection, work on those projects you&#8217;ve been putting off, read that pile of magazines next to your desk. Needless to say, none of these things got done around my house.
