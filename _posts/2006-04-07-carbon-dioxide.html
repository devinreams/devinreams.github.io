<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060408/ap_on_re_us/mammoth_deaths">Two ski patrol members died of asphyixation</a>. They fell into a volcanic fissure and the deadly gasses killed them. As I read the sad news I realize it just confused me. "...authorities on Friday identified the deadly gas as carbon dioxide... emissions from the ground have previously been linked to die-offs of trees in the region". You're trying to tell me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_a">carbon dioxide</a> has started killing off trees?
