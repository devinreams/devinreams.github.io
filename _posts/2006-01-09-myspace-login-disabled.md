Perhaps the one time I try to sign onto MySpace and it says ?Login is temporarily disabled while we fix some database problems. We?ll be back shortly?. Um, I feel that one second is one second too long. I haven?t seen this on Facebook, kiddies. I definitely couldn?t tolerate seeing a message like that more than once. I don?t understand why a ?login is down? page must show up, either. Can?t changes be made offline then transferred? Scalability is a bitch, I guess. Do you see this very often, Nick?
