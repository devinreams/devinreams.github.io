Chris Yeh has put together his [theory behind blogging][1]. It&#8217;s clever. It makes sense when you read it. In short: the more you talk about, the less focused you are, the less readership your site will enjoy. In other words, if you don&#8217;t write for a niche you won&#8217;t be &#8220;successful.&#8221;

<!--more-->

If you know my site you may say I&#8217;m scattered. I write about business, college, technology, websites, productivity, and personal stuff. If you started visiting my site today you&#8217;d figure I had no focus and simply talked about whatever I wanted to, whenever I wanted to.

Which is fine.

All these blog experts say &#8220;keep focused&#8221; and &#8220;write for a niche.&#8221; These people go start blog networks or niche blogs&#8230; about blogging. Well, not many blog networks are successful (as a whole, the separate entities like Engadget and BoingBoing are) and, blogs about blogging only appeal to, you&#8217;ve got it, bloggers. It&#8217;s these same people that say I&#8217;m doing too much with my own website.

Haha, I agree!

But wait a second, are you *sure* I&#8217;m not focused and writing for a niche?

I&#8217;m writing for the people who enjoy business, college, technology&#8230; get the point? Imagine my readership as a conversion of venn diagrams. Lifehacker has maybe two circles that define their readers: geeks and people interested in productivity. That means they have a huge pool of readers.

Me? I have a bunch of circles overlap. Thus, my writing finds a much more focused, much more niche-like audience than most people.

Sure, it starts to limit the number of people that fit within the overlaps. But, don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;m not writing for the right audience. Don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;m covering too much. I&#8217;m writing for the people that enjoy everything I write about. These are the people I can chat with. These are the folks I can easily befriend. These are the people I want to connect with through writing.

By the same token, I can&#8217;t go over to Lifehacker and enjoy everything they write. I can&#8217;t go to Problogger and call any of those people like-minded friends. But, the readers at Devin Reams dot com? Wow. They&#8217;re the best group of people on the internet I could ever find.
