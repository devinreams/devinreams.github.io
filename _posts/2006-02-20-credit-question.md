Is it normal for a bank to extend your credit limit without any kind of request? I wasn&#8217;t able to effectively Google that particular question. Anyway, Wells Fargo just upped my limit a little bit today with no notice whatsoever. I looked around and their site said they don&#8217;t extend additional credit until you&#8217;re a customer for a year. I&#8217;ve only been around 4 months. Oh well, it&#8217;s still less than Dell Premiere is willing to risk on me, though.
