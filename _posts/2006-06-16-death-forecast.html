According to the Death Forecast <a href="http://www.deathforecast.com/result.php?record=177640">I'm going to die at a ripe old age of 74</a>. Gee only 55 years left. Then again, I could get hit by a bus this afternoon. I don't even know why I did this survey... I should live as if tomorrow were the last day. Hmm...
