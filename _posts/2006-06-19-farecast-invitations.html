Anyone interested in testing out <a href="http://www.farecast.com/">Farecast</a>? It's a very nice (beautiful, functional) website to help predict and find the best fares based on price histories. Right now it only serves Seattle/Boston markets but it's great to play around with. I have a bunch of invites; just leave a comment.
