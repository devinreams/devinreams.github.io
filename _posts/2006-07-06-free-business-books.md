Okay, so I&#8217;ve been keeping a secret from all my readers, I haven&#8217;t bought a book in over a year. Yet I&#8217;ve probably read 4 or so. &#8220;But Devin, how can you read books if you haven&#8217;t bought any?!&#8221; My answer to you is: have you ever heard of the library? Then my second answer to you is: have you ever heard of [inBubbleWrap][1]? It&#8217;s a side-project brought to you by the great people at [800-CEO-READ][2] and it basically functions as a daily drawing for a free book. I&#8217;ve won three so far. I&#8217;m in the process of reading [China, Inc][3] which I got in the mail a few weeks ago. Another good way to get free books is to ask publishers for a copy in exchange for a review. I&#8217;ve scored another 3 or 4 this way and have a review to post shortly (way overdue). There you have it, my secret is out&#8230;
