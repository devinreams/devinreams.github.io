I haven't had time to check out the new hit show, Heroes, on NBC but I hear it's pretty good. It's a show about ordinary citizens that realize they have supernatural powers. Wow. Of course its a hit, X-Men was, too. Seriously, the <a href="http://blogs.nbcuni.com/heroes/2006/09/xmen_comparisons.php#comments">Heroes blog</a> doesn't seem to appreciate people making the connection. If you ask me, the premise is identical. The reason people seem to enjoy this show a bit more is the overwhelming amounts of drama and lack of goofy superhero costumes. At least, that's my guess.

I'd also venture to say people enjoy a show like this because it allows us to escape. We think "wow that'd be neat if I had some sort of power." Why? Is there a reason we need an advantage over others? Do some of us feel cheated and need something that others don't have? I wonder...

Instead of fantasizing over individuals with unrealistic powers why don't we have shows highlighting amazing people who are the same as you and I? Would that make us feel insignificant? Are we incapable of doing great things and don't want to be reminded of it? I wonder...

Personally, I don't have these issues because I know I have a power. I destroy light bulbs. In the last 24 hours I've broken two light bulbs. Two lamps on my desk burnt out. I thought it was odd so I tried a bulb in another lamp. I underestimated my own strength and broke the bulb in my hand. The next morning I went to the garage and that light burnt out, too. Perhaps it's not a superpower, perhaps I'm just so strong and scary the bulbs tremble when I'm about.

I guess I like to fantasize too...
