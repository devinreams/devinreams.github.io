I'm in a good mood and my brilliant mentor, <a href="http://okdork.com/">noah</a>, suggested I create a caption contest for the following picture:

<center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/2347003136/" title="Reading the paper by devinreams, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2085/2347003136_76556a6007_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Reading the paper" /></a></center>

<strike>Winner receives a $10 Amazon.com gift certificate. <strong>Leave your caption in the comments.</strong></strike>

<strong>Winner:</strong> With my invisible knife, I stab at thee, foul editor.

<em>PS: Photo taken with my new iPhone (on T-Mobile, ask me how!).</em>
