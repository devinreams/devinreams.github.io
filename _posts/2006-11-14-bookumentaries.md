I enjoy reading, it truly expands my knowledge base and introduces me to so many great new ideas. In turn, I enjoy sharing them and talking with others about them. But recently I&#8217;ve struggled to find time to read. As [mentioned before][1], I manage my time pretty closely; I fill every hour of my schedule. Unfortunately, work and school take up nearly all of my time lately. When can I find time to read?

I&#8217;m not the fastest reader, nor am I the slowest. But reading does take a serious investment of time. Luckily I can read while at the gym on a bike but I realize once I sit down to read I can&#8217;t do anything else. That time is entirely devoted to reading. Whereas, if I&#8217;m watching TV I can eat, skim email, or even work out.

So, I figure I need to couple the content and density of a book with the convenience and entertainment of television. Gasp, I just stumbled upon the formula for a documentary. Look at the success Michael Moore enjoyed. The History and Discovery Channels are largely dedicated to entertainment and education via documentaries. How many of the documentaries from [this list][2] have you seen? I&#8217;m sure most of you have see a number of them&#8230;

So why can&#8217;t I start producing bookumentaries? I&#8217;d love to sit down and talk with the authors and the smart individuals who put together these amazing books. I&#8217;d enjoy helping them reach a broader audience. Like I said, I enjoy sharing and discussing these ideas with people but many face the same challenge as I do: there isn&#8217;t as much time to dedicate to reading as we&#8217;d like.

Is there something keeping authors from doing this in the first place? Is it simply easier to sit down and write than produce the content in a visual manner? Is this something that would detract from the content? I don&#8217;t think so. I must say that, when done well, a documentary can take a lot of material and make it flow together seamlessly. Go watch the new Discovery Atlas series; they&#8217;re amazing.

What do you think? Do you read a lot? Would you rather watch an hour documentary on something like [The Tipping Point][3] or [The Starfish and the Spider][4] or spend a few hours to read the book? This is something I&#8217;d really like to do and I&#8217;d like to think out-loud about it a bit more&#8230;
