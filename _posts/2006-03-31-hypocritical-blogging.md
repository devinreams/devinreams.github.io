As I sat here reading over 100 RSS feeds, I just had a realization: I&#8217;m a hypocritical blogger.

I post regularly and expect hundreds of people to read what I say.

Yet, I read (scan) hundreds of blogs thinking: &#8220;That&#8217;s crap. That&#8217;s stupid. Oh that&#8217;s very interesting! Why&#8217;d that person post that? Why do people think that&#8217;s so clever?&#8221; I&#8217;ve been going through blogs lately wondering: why do I do this when so much of it is of little value to me? I spend a lot of time reading and at this point I don&#8217;t even know how much of that will continue&#8230;

But, at the same time I want people to come back to my blog and read what I&#8217;m saying, find it useful, and leave insightful responses. How can I expect bloggers to read what I say if I refuse to read what they&#8217;re saying?

I think the simple answer is (for me, not everyone): quality over quantity. This simple rule applies to my subscribers, traffic, links and &#8211;most importantly&#8211; content.  
With that in mind I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll be shifting my writing style&#8230;

..and reading style.

Some of the first to leave my reader? Sad to say but it&#8217;s the A-listers, like [Steve Rubel][1], [Robert Scoble][2], and [Jason Calacanis][3].  
Why get rid of these guys? They&#8217;re clever, sure, but:

*   they largely point to content I can find elsewhere
*   there&#8217;s just way too much stuff
*   egos are a bitch and get in the way of a blog&#8217;s quality sometimes

You can tell the difference between those blogging for blogging and those blogging for an audience. Seth Godin is my favorite blogger becuase he&#8217;s short, sweet and his posts are full of greatness.

[Guy][4] has been dropped because, although he&#8217;s got good stuff:

*   you can find it all in his books
*   everyone else quotes his latest posts
*   it takes a long time to read everything he says

But, hey, he got his link like [he asked][5]&#8230;
