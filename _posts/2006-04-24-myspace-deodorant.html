As a follow up to <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/04/23/myspace-to-advertise/">this post</a> (and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/business/yourmoney/23myspace.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5088&en=68144371c2be06ac&ex=1303444800&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">this article</a>) my brother has created, by far, the best <a href="http://www.myspace.com/deoderizer  ">MySpace profile out there</a> (http://www.myspace.com/deoderizer). I hope 'Right' starts sending me ads and coupons soon! Maybe he'll even fill out my 'ten things' bulletin!
