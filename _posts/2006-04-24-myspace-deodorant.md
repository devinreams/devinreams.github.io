As a follow up to [this post][1] (and [this article][2]) my brother has created, by far, the best [MySpace profile out there][3] (http://www.myspace.com/deoderizer). I hope &#8216;Right&#8217; starts sending me ads and coupons soon! Maybe he&#8217;ll even fill out my &#8216;ten things&#8217; bulletin!
