If you can&#8217;t tell I love to be organized and lay everything out. I can be *very* spur of the moment (let me tell you about the time we went skiing at midnight until 2am, slept in my car, then drove to Vail the next morning&#8230;) but in general I like to know what the plan is.

I&#8217;ve been looking at my [schedule][1] (I put it into Excel, colors and all, very fun!) and there&#8217;s plenty of empty space. I realized if I don&#8217;t put anything in there I will probably sit around, read blogs, poke around on Facebook, etc. I figured that theres plenty I could get done in this time if I just made a schedule&#8230;

<img width="64" height="96" align="right" id="image60" alt="workout.jpg" src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/workout.jpg" />So, I&#8217;ve added &#8216;working out&#8217; to a few days each week. I had put this down as a New Year&#8217;s resolution and I plan to keep this one (in addition to [reading a book a month][2]). The biggest step is making something a habit. Since I go to class every day I decided that once I get home I&#8217;ll just go work out. I may have to scold myself (&#8216;No Devin! No email until you get back!&#8217;) but I think scheduling the time should help.

I&#8217;ve actually signed up for [CARGO&#8217;s BootCamp][3] and found plenty of routines to get me through the weeks. I didn&#8217;t even really know what pilates was until I saw this site. In any case, The &#8216;camp&#8217; is free once you sign up and it has everything you need to get started. The hardest part is starting!

I think I&#8217;ll start reading the &#8216;food&#8217; section and see what I can do about my diet, too&#8230;
