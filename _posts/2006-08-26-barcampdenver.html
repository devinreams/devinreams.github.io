<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/225489517/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/72/225489517_703d0d6b30_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="BarCampDenver" style="float:right;padding-left:7px;" /></a>I spent a few hours at the first <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampDenver">BarCampDenver</a> today. It was nice to sit down and have a conversation, include the term 'Wordpress' and not be the only one to understand what the hell it is. But seriously, it was fun and interesting and I got to chat with <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampDenverAttendees">some cool folks</a> (ones I had only seen and heard about online). I look forward to future geek events around town...
