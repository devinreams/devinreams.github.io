I've had a bit more free time lately. I took the summer off (between graduation and my full-time job) and have spent a lot of time playing, relaxing, reading. All the things I didn't have time for just a few weeks ago. <span class="highlight">Do you know what you'd do with an extra day of free time?</span> Just one more day each week: how would I spend it?

	Would I study? Would I read a book? Would I fly a kite? Would I find new clients? Exercise more?

	When you find a good answer I think you'll see this is a good exercise in determining your personal priorities.

	The truth is, you're all very smart, very capable people. Unfortunately the time we have here is finite. <span class="highlight">We may be capable of <em>anything</em>, but we don't have time for <em>everything</em>.</span>

	So, how do you spend your days? Is it time to move on from your current job? Is school the best use of your time? Should you spend more time to yourself or with friends watching a movie? What would you do if you had an extra day to yourself?

	...why aren't you doing that right now?
