The Oreo CEO himself has <a href="http://oreoceo.com/notes/7-tunes/">tagged me</a> with a meme. I like this one becuase you can tell <em>a lot</em> by a person's music.

With that said, here are 7 random songs from my collection...
<!--more-->
<ol>
<li>Guster - Two Points for Honest</li>
<li>E-40 - Go Hard or Go Home</li>
<li>Missy Elliott - Partytime</li>
<li>Yung Jock - It's Goin' Down</li>
<li>Dave Matthews - Stay or Leave</li>
<li>Chingy - Brand New Kicks</li>
<li>Head Automatica - Curious</li>
</ol>

Diverse, wouldn't you say? As an added bonus <a href="http://devinreams.com/etc/MALoseControl.mov">I decided to make a music video when I heard Missy Elliott</a> come up. It's much harder than I initally thought. Enjoy your Friday.

Oh, and for more insight, here's <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/devdev">my last.fm page</a> (recently reset).
