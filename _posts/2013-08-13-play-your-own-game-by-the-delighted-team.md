This is the [concise series of points](https://delightedapp.com/blog/play-your-own-game) I wish one of my drafts had become (after chatting with and listening to folks from "competing" firms such as Voce Platforms, 10up, WebDevStudios, and others):

> There&#8217;s no limit on the number of companies that can be successful, because there isn&#8217;t a universal definition of success. Some companies strive for the lowest prices, others to provide the most jobs, some to be the most efficient, and some strive for the highest possible quality. There are endless possible combinations. And that is a great thing to be celebrated. 

Well said. The entire thing is a great read.
