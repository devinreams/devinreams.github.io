I was bored and I realized how much fun pictures are. Seriously, I love the vast amount of media (video, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/">pictures</a>, <a href="http://lifewithwomen.com/">comics</a>, <a href="http://yopos.com/category/podcast/">audio</a>) online. I decided I was going to try to post a new picture on Flickr every day (until I run out of bandwith (or stop being cheap)). I posted a few today and created corresponding groups. The first is a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/188389946/">picture of my keys</a>; I'm interested in what everyone elses' key chain looks like. The second is a screengrab from my semi-secret <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/188402482/">Facebook friends photo mosaic</a>. Yay pictures!
