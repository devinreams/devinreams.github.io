<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/01/death_by_riskav.html">Kathy Sierra has a nice post on risk aversion</a> which I especially like because of her awesome 'USAToday approach' to explaining concepts (using pretty pictures). If you don't feel like reading everything she has to say, you can at least loose yourself in a picture of a tree for a few minutes. That point aside, Seth has always said that safe is risky, etc. In my case, I love being a 'leaf node' and the 'manager' at the same time. I guess being creative and creating your own products allows you to do that. Fortunately for me I'm not tied down by a big company. I'm in college and can play around with whatever I feel like. I can't wait to release my current 'project'...
