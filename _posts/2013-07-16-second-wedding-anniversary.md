Time flies. It&#8217;s already been two years since [Rachel and I tied the knot][1] at the Denver Botanic Gardens. In the past year, we&#8217;ve had a lot of fun adventures together: visiting New Orleans for the first time, camping a few times (and forgetting most of the supplies once), hiked Hanging Lake, watched the new Arrested Development episodes (loose seal!), painted fat penguins with friends, planted a vegetable garden, skied at Steamboat for the first time, nordic skied for the first (and last?) time, cheered on the CU Buffs in person for the first time in years, started golf lessons, played in a bowling league (really?), helped friends move, had an appendix removed, enjoyed opening night of The Book of Mormon, visited the Dominican Republic *and* Lake Powell with respective families, installed flagstone (and removed sod by hand, sorry). It&#8217;s been a great year!

Here&#8217;s to many more, Rachel&#8230;
