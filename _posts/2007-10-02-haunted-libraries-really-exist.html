According to George Eberhart at the Britannica blogs, <a href="http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2007/09/haunted-libraries-in-the-us-alabama-dc/">there are a number of haunted libraries throughout the country</a>. I <a href="http://9rules.com/Education/notes/7251/">asked 9rules</a> and am curious: why do you think libraries are often portrayed as haunted, and do people still visit libraries?
