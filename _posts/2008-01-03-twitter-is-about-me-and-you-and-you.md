When you sign up and join [Twitter][1] it&#8217;s about a lot of things. Some say it&#8217;s an [ecosystem][2], [it&#8217;s about the simplicity][3], it&#8217;s about the [voyeurism][4], [it&#8217;s communication porn][5] and so on.

I think it&#8217;s also like walking into a chatroom with *just* the people you want. Any other chatroom (IRC, AOL, Yahoo Games!) has a bunch of folks that are &#8216;noise&#8217; and you&#8217;re not always interested in. With Twitter you can tune them out (setting: only see @replies to people you mutually follow). This is important because **my experience is tailored to me and different from everyone else&#8217;s.** I follow different people so even though my social circles may overlap with hundreds of people I don&#8217;t have to be involuntarily involved in those conversations.

When my experience is just about me and the people I want to interact with then I find that valuable. Facebook, Plaxo and LinkedIn have screwed this up because they&#8217;re overwhelming me with information about people that don&#8217;t *always* matter to me. MySpace realized that we should be able to opt-in to our friends because, of many reasons, some people change their profile picture too much, or leave groups too much, or add applications too much, or&#8230; whatever reason you want.

Twitter means the updates I receive are from the people I want, the conversations are with the people I want, and even more importantly: the content is limited to what they want (to divulge). I believe this control is missing from sites like Facebook and is why so many people hide and remove all their feed activity. In some cases, those are the people I want to &#8216;follow&#8217; the most.
