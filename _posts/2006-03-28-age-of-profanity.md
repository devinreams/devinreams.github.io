An [AP article on profanity][1] made me wonder: are swear words becoming mainstream? I was thinking about this last night while watching some ABC Family. I thought to myself: &#8220;this is what ABC considered &#8216;family&#8217; material?&#8221; I suppose the downward spiral is inevitable. Besides, they&#8217;re just words right? Personally, I find it very hard to express myself on here sometimes becuase I choose not to use certain words. I think these colorful words have begun replacing thoughtful adjectives&#8230;
