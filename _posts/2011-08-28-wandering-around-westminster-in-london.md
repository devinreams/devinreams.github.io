\[Alex\](http://alexking.org) and I had a spare day to sight see around London while traveling on business; we made sure to see all as many sights as we could. One afternoon we walked towards the London Eye, crossed over towards Trafalgar Square, visited the National Gallery, stopped by Buckingham Palace, back down to Big Ben and parliment, then back past the London Eye. All in all we walked over 8 miles that day (including back to our hotel).
