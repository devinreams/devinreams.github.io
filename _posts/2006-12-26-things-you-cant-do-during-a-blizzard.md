With a lot of snow comes a lot of fun, obviously. By the same token, you become quite limited in what you can do. Having a blizzard half a week before Christmas sure makes things tricky. Here&#8217;s my list of the top five things you *can&#8217;t* do during a blizzard.

## 5. Mow the lawn

It just wouldn&#8217;t seem appropriate nor possible- so don&#8217;t try.

## 4. Have a bad attitude

Whining won&#8217;t make the snow go away. Complaining won&#8217;t change the situation. You have to make the best of it (hint: go outside and play).

## 3. Be selfish

You&#8217;ve certainly got to be a bit generous and helpful to everyone around you. You may be trapped in an airport or stuck in a snow bank&#8211; wouldn&#8217;t you want someone to help you out? Just make sure you tip real well; &#8217;tis the season.

## 2. See anyone

Unless you&#8217;re a nerd (or MacBook owner) you don&#8217;t have a webcam. You&#8217;re trapped with those great people you&#8217;ve always co-inhabited your home with. That is, unless you&#8217;re trapped somewhere else. In that case, you could be in a much worse position. Even worse, someone you don&#8217;t particularly want to spend two-plus days with could be trapped with you.

## 1. Go anywhere

Which includes: Go shopping for Christmas presents, go shopping for groceries, go buy medicine, go buy supplies, go to the gym, go to work, go to school, go to your friends&#8217; houses, go skiing (unless it&#8217;s cross-country to the aforementioned places), go dancing, go to the clubs, go to the bars, go to a restaurant, go to the movies, etc.

**Goodness help you if the power goes out.**
