There has been plenty of coverage of \[23andme\](http://23andme.com), lately[^1]. Like any self-respecting nerd (I took three years of biology in high school) I had my own DNA analyzed. If you&#8217;re not aware: you send a spit sample which is reviewed for known DNA markers to help identify traits, your propensity towards certain diseases and ancestry.

While I agree the ability to learn more about diseases (as an individual and the scientific community at-large) is an amazing step, I&#8217;m also interested in learning what was previously dismissed as un-knowable. Having been adopted at birth, I&#8217;ve only had a superficial understanding of my ancestry. Not knowing my biological family, I&#8217;ve had no insight into any history of diseases or traits, either.

For many people, they can say &#8220;grandma had Parkinson&#8217;s, and her sister did, too&#8221; and understand there is a chance they&#8217;re pre-disposed to this disease. Or people can look at their father and say &#8220;well that&#8217;s where these freckles came from.&#8221; Though incidental, these are experiences and conversations I&#8217;ve never had throughout my life.

It&#8217;s interesting to me how 23andme has closed a gap that some might not even be aware of. It&#8217;s helped shift knowledge back to the individual.

\[^1]: I always point people to the WIRED article about [Sergey Brin's search for a Parkinson's disease cure\](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/06/ff\_sergeys\_search/).
