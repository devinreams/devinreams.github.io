I have two invites to a very cool website. It&#8217;s called [Moola][1] and it&#8217;s very simple: you get a penny (real money) to play against someone else with a penny. The winner of the game wins the other person&#8217;s money. So, if you win 30 games in a row (.01, .02, .04, .08&#8230;) you can win over $10,000,000. You can cash out at any time, too. All you do is watch a quick ad, answer a question (to prove you saw it) and then play! So, the first two people to comment will receive an invitation. Only smart people can apply though, I want you guys winning me some money (referral bonus)!
