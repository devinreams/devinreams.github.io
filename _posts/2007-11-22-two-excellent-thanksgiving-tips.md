From [Keith Ferrazzi][1]:

> I do try to consciously practice gratitude every day, but certainly Thanksgiving is a reminder to us all. I recall driving up to Santa Barbara to meet some friends for the holiday one year and just scrolling through my cell phone and dialing people to say how grateful I was at that very moment for their presence in my life. How truly blessed I am, for so many different reasons, for the moments these people, like my writing partner Tahl Raz, walked into my life. The more people I called, the better I felt about myself and the world. What a gift it was to give to myself and I absolutely encourage you to try it&#8230; [follow the discussion at the never eat along blog][2].

From [DailyOM][3]:

> Often when we practice being thankful, we go through the process of counting our blessings, acknowledging the wonderful people, things and places that make up our reality. While it is fine to be grateful for the good fortune we have accumulated, true thankfulness stems from a powerful comprehension of the gift of simply being alive, and when we feel it, we feel it regardless of our circumstances. In this deep state of gratitude, we recognize the purity of the experience of being, in and of itself, and our thankfulness is part and parcel of our awareness that we are one with this great mystery that is life&#8230; [follow the discussion at DailyOM][4].

From [Tim Ferriss][5]:

> From Thanksgiving to next Thursday, November 29th, ask yourself the following question each morning, immediately upon waking up and before getting out of bed:
> 
> **What am I truly grateful for in my life?**
> 
> Aim for five answers, and if you have trouble at first, ask yourself alternative probing questions such as:
> 
> What relationships do I have that others don
