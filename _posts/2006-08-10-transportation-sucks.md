I&#8217;m pissed: &#8220;NO LIQUIDS OR GELS OF ANY KIND WILL BE PERMITTED IN CARRY-ON BAGGAGE. ITEMS MUST BE IN CHECKED BAGGAGE. This includes all beverages, shampoo, suntan lotion, creams, tooth paste, hair gel, and other items of similar consistency&#8221; ([Link][1]). I never check a bag, ever. I always put everything in the backpack and rolling luggage. There is no fucking way this is keeping us safer. Simple as that. The damned terrorists have won.
