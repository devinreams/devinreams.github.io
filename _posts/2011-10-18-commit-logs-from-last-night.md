We at [Crowd Favorite][1] get email notifications for every commit in the company. This leads to some fairly entertaining commit messages coming across. Mine typically consist of &#8220;oops, forgot semicolon&#8221; just because I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. I can see how this site could take off pretty quickly in the developer community.
