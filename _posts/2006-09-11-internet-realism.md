I&#8217;d like to quickly talk about the idealization going on with the internet. These last few days (or maybe a week or two?) away from my own website have helped me realize something oh-so important&#8230;

## The internet is only important if you make it important.

<!--more-->

It&#8217;s funny because as I was sitting and thinking about this I was also debating going through my RSS feeds. I figured, the world has survived this long without me reading them, I&#8217;m still human without going through them, why bother? To illustrate my lack of control, yes, I did read them. I also happened upon a friend of mine who shares my thoughts. Scrivs says [&#8220;I don&#8217;t need the web&#8221;][1].

I don&#8217;t either.

I used to. I used to think I needed to read my websites, check on Flickr photos and update my blog with something clever or witty. I thought I needed to do this (among many other things) every day. You know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about. Your routine might include surfing digg or checking news on Slashdot or even browsing new additions on deviantart. I realize none of these things really affect my life. So, I sat down and asked myself:

## Which websites affect me and my life?

I thought about this even beyond the &#8216;web 2.0&#8242; scene. I mean, think about the internet and all the websites you happen to visit. Do any matter? The following are the *only* websites that have some bearing on my life.

1.  **GMail** &#8211; Email from friends, family, school, etc. Primary means of communication. A close second is my cell phone.
2.  **Google Calendar** &#8211; In order to save precious brain space I dump everything onto my calendar. I wouldn&#8217;t know what I was doing at any given point without it.
3.  **Colorado.edu** &#8211; Naturally I do everything from registration to pay tuition to check homework through various portals. I can&#8217;t imagine college life without the internet.
4.  **Wells Fargo, American Express, Vanguard, IndyMac, EmigrantDirect** &#8211; I manage all my finances (checking, savings, CDs and a Roth IRA) online. I haven&#8217;t stepped in a bank for a solid year or two (and that was just because the ATM broke). I&#8217;ve never spoken to anyone from my banks on the phone.
5.  **Facebook** &#8211; Another primary means of communication and socializing in college. Don&#8217;t get me started on the news feed debate though&#8230;

That&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s my five! There are over a dozen sites on my bookmark toolbar in FireFox, though. How can that be? Do I really need all of them? Newsvine? Maybe. Or can I simply pick up the WSJ between classes? Flickr? It&#8217;s nice, but not necessary. More than 2 million pictures are uploaded to Facebook each day, that seems like the place I need to be paying attention. What about meebo? Nah, not really.

I dare you, reflect on your daily websites and how they affect your lives. Link back or leave a comment and let me know your thoughts. How much time are you going to save just by reading your own words here? Personally, I&#8217;ll be saving at least two hours each day.

**Wow, 2 hours? Look how easy it&#8217;s going to be for me to &#8216;earn back&#8217; two full days this month!**
