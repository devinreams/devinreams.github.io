I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/">Crash</a> last weekend and it was fantastic. Today I noticed that <a href="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/2006/01/2006_oscar_nominations.html">it was nominated for a few Acadamy Awards</a>.

Rightfully so.

<img width="67" height="96" align="right" alt="crash.jpg" id="image85" src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/crash.jpg" />This movie is a 'simultanious drama' where many peoples' lives are intertwined. In short, Crash is an awesome look at racism and how it motivates people's behavior. As Malcolm Gladwell has said, we can't just ignore race. Our mind constantly 'thin slices' the world around us. Unfortunately, we have little to no control over this process...

The characters in the movie demonstrate this point through some of society's most extreme sterotypes, beliefs, and their respective actions (and reactions). Crash is, as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/">IMDB</a> describes it, a "no-nonsense look at the way life is for so many". I especially liked this opening quote:
<blockquote>"It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."</blockquote>
I'd give this movie a 10/10. If you haven't seen it yet, you know what you need to do now...
