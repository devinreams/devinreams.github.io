Just a few of the important lessons I've learned here in Austin.

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/devinreams/status/1332019417">Sleep is precious.</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/devinreams/status/1336276898">Housekeeping doesn't know that.</a></li>
	<li><strike>Dodgeball</strike><a href="http://playfoursquare.com">Foursquare is fun to play.</a></li>
	<li>Companies: Twitter is not the secret to success (nor the end-game); <a href="http://twitter.zappos.com/">you're not Zappos</a>.</li>
	<li>People really like BBQ in Texas.</li>
	<li><a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk is still a badass.</a></li>
	<li>But, other cyber celebrities like <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a> becomes less respectable (and relevant) each and every day.</li>
	<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a> talks the same way he writes: smartly (and hasn't had to buy himself a drink in 7 years, his words).</li>
	<li>Companies: Despite the "convenience" of the internet, people still love picking up a phone and talking to a smart, capable human.</li>
	<li>Nerd conferences are the only place you'll see <a href="http://twitter.com/alexkingorg/status/1330409004">lines for the men's bathroom</a> but not the women's.</li>
</ol>
