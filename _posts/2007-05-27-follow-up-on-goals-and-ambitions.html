When I earned the Boy Scout rank of Eagle I had to write a letter of my 'Life Goals and Ambitions'. I rediscovered this letter the other day and it was a real eye-opener. I said a lot of interesting things that I wouldn't have guessed. I realized today it's important to revisit your future plans...

	<h2>Five years ago...</h2>



	<blockquote>My life ambitions include reaching the rank of Eagle Scout, graduating from high school with an International Baccalaureate degree, going to college and <span class="highlight">becoming an entrepreneur</span> ... I want to study and obtain degrees and certifications in Computer Science. Of of my goals is to become a Cisco Certified Networks Associate. This certification will broaden my knowledge of computer networks and will provide a pathway to great job opportunities. I would also like to <span class="highlight">graduate from college with a Computer Science degree</span> ... I would like to study in <span class="highlight">California</span> because I believe the technological environment makes it a great place to learn ... I want to <span class="highlight">start my own technology business</span> with the knowledge I've obtained. I feel with the new knowledge I will have, and my current skills, I can start and run a technology company. As time goes on, <span class="highlight">I might change my mind</span> or I might have a different idea for the company I would start. But, I believe starting a business would provide me the opportunity to continue to challenge myself and exercise my leadership abilities.</blockquote>

	That silly kid seemed to know what he was talking about. <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/12/06/do-you-need-long-term-goals/">I talked about the idea of long-term goals before.</a> I think it's good to have direction and it's obvious that I had one.

	<h2>Five years later...</h2>

	I look back and yes, I became Eagle, I graduated with my diplomas and I graduated college with a degree. But, I didn't get it in Computer Science. In fact, I wasn't even in the engineering school. I began an Information Systems degree and I even changed that to Accounting.

	So what happened? I realized I didn't want to remain technical. I decided job opportunities aren't all they're cracked up to be. There's more to it (like enjoying what you do). I also saw what happened to technology companies in California. Times change, so could I.

	Did I fail at reaching my goals? I wouldn't look at it that way. I may not be a CCNA and I may not have my own business. But, I feel like I'm still on the right path. I'm still learning and I'm still gaining leadership experience.

	<h2>Evaluate your goals</h2>

	It's important to see where you think you're headed. At this point it's like I'm on a road trip. I'm starting in Boston and I know I want to be on the West coast. I start driving and I hit a fork. At that point, I'll I decide what to do. I have no map, just a sense of direction. Maybe I'll detour down to New Orleans. Perhaps I'll stop in Kansas for a bit. I don't know. I don't even know which state I'm aiming for. I'm simply headed in the general direction...

	Do I still want to be a technology entrepreneur? I don't know. I think I'll sit down and write up some ideas of what I hope to do in a few years.

	It'll be fun to look back... again.
