	<blockquote>I do try to consciously practice gratitude every day, but certainly Thanksgiving is a reminder to us all.

	<blockquote>From Thanksgiving to next Thursday, November 29th, ask yourself the following question each morning, immediately upon waking up and before getting out of bed:

	<strong>What am I truly grateful for in my life?</strong>

	Aim for five answers, and if you have trouble at first, ask yourself alternative probing questions such as:

	What relationships do I have that others don
