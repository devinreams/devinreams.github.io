You may have heard the expression

> If he cheated *with* you, he will cheat *on* you.

I&#8217;ve lived this first-hand, and it was an &#8220;aha!&#8221; moment early in life. A lot of things about personalities and relationships clicked after thinking about that simple fact.

Since then, I&#8217;ve noticed the same thinking can be applied to business: potential clients, potential employees, potential employers, etc.

If someone has &#8220;had terrible vendors&#8221; in the past or &#8220;worked for horrific bosses&#8221; or &#8220;has had terrible luck keeping good employees&#8221; it&#8217;s certainly something to commiserate with them about, but then an opportunity to dig deeper and find out why.
