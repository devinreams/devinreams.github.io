I took a class at CU called &#8220;School and Society.&#8221; We discussed home schooling and how the largest argument against the kids being anti-social is the fact they spend time with others in the community.. ie: Spelling Bees. [This interesting video][1] encompasses a lot of what I&#8217;ve thought about home schooled children: 1) they don&#8217;t know how to be social, 2) they believe they are better than other kids, and 3) they think competing with peers is suitable interaction. The best part? It&#8217;s not really their fault. I think a lot of parents are doing their children a huge disservice. When you raise kids they believe what you say; they see what you show them and learn what you teach them. Education, religion, values&#8230; wow. It&#8217;s not until many many years later you get to decide this stuff for yourself. That was a fun realization.
