[The PlayStation Network is now shut down indefinitely following a security breach.][1] I have no problem with that fact I can&#8217;t access supplementary online multiplayer gaming. But, I can&#8217;t wrap my head around why PSN has its tentacles in every downloadable application I&#8217;ve installed. Hulu, which has its own very nice authentication system, cannot be accessed now (ever again?) because I must pass my credentials through PSN. Why is this PSN layer mandatory and in front of an application that has nothing to do with PlayStation&#8217;s network? I haven&#8217;t tried but I assume the same is true for MLB.tv<strike> and the Netflix app</strike>. I&#8217;m calling it: the Apple TV is much better positioned to foster the app economy and will capture the lion&#8217;s share of the &#8220;box connected to TV&#8221; market (video, games, movies) by popularizing a much better ecosystem in the 6-8 months PlayStation spends rebuilding PSN.
