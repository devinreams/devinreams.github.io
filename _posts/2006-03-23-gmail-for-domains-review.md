Today I received my invitation to manage my email through Gmail. If you hadn&#8217;t heard about [this (beta) service][1] yet, you&#8217;re either [Nick][2] or you live in a Google-free cave.

At first glance, it&#8217;s so simple and effective. First off, I decided I should try this because I hate my current webmail alternative (for devinreams.com). I thought, &#8220;hey, if Gmail works so well with my other email why wouldn&#8217;t I want to try this?&#8221; So, I have. I switched my MX domain and during dinner everything was updated and functioning. I quickly enabled POP support and was downloading my email through Outlook. The best part is that my email is now stored on Google&#8217;s servers. Sure, you may be hesitant, but for me this is very important. I started finding myself missing email conversations becuase when I send them, they&#8217;re only saved on my PC. That sucks.

But, enough about that, here is some of the goodness:

**Administrator&#8217;s Dashboard**

</p>

The administrator&#8217;s dashboard is pretty simply. One interesting note: my account plan is &#8216;Free&#8217; which means I get &#8216;Up to 10 users free&#8217;. I assume a value-added premium service is in the works.

**Users**

</p>

</p>

Creating users is very straight-forward. First name, last name, email address and set a password. The AJAX-y goodness is definitely a big part of the awesome ease-of-use this service presents.

**Email Lists**

You can also create email lists. This is pretty neat because I can create, for instance, a managers@mycompany.com that emails the entire management. Very neat but you can&#8217;t limit access to mailing to the list (unlike Google Groups).

As far as the sign-in page is concerned you can &#8216;personalize it&#8217; by changing the sign-in box&#8217;s color and a logo (see [this page][4] for an example, versus [mine][5]). Apparently when I try to change anything I&#8217;m greeted by a blank page&#8230; so, a work in progress I suppose. Plus, you can dis/allow the use of user emails for Google Talk.

So, in short, it only took me two minutes to set this up. The domain information synched while I ate dinner and I had fully-Google-managed email running in less than 10 minutes. It actually took me longer to write this blog post than set up my account. I&#8217;m happy to have spam-free email though, now. If you&#8217;d like to take a look and play for yourself, feel free to leave me a comment&#8230;
