I visited the Denver Botanic Gardens, nearly three years after [Rachel and I were married there](http://devinandrachel.com/the-wedding/), with her family to see the Chihuly art exhibit.

The glass art and sculptures were well adapted to their environments and a beautiful addition to the gardens.

Check out [my photos](http://photos.devin.reams.me/chihuly-at-denver-botanic-gardens) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co).
