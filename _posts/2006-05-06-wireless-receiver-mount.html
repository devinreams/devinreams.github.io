I decided I wanted to use my keyboard tray. Unfortunately my wireless MCE keyboard needs line-of-sight to communicate with the receiver. So, I mounted the receiver on the back of the desk with a binder clip, staple, and a twist tie. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/tags/diy/">Go check out the photos</a>, it's genuis really.
