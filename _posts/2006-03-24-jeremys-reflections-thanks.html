Hah, I have one of the coolest bosses ever. I use the term 'boss' a big liberally because I only work a few hours a month with him. <a href="http://www.ensight.org/">Jeremy Wright</a>, author, entreprentur, blogger, and all-around cool guy has <a href="http://www.pheedo.com/click.phdo?i=1bce6807f935bdde261c66866719a9bd">reflected on his last 6 months</a> running <a href="http://www.b5media.com/">his (very successful) blog network</a>. How do I know it's successful? I'm the guy who crunches the numbers and tells Jeremy how much to pay each of his 50-plus bloggers. I almost forgot blogging could be so lucrative (I shoot to earn $1/day with my Adsense). In any case, I appreciated his mention. From one guy to another I realize how tricky it may be to express any kind of feelings so I appreciate his... appreciation. I, too, look forward to the next 6 months.
