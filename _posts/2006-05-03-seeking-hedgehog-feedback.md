As you may recall, I defined my [Hedgehog Concept][1] by determining [what I can be the best in the world at][2]. I was able to accomplish this by understanding some of [my best qualities][3]. I&#8217;ve learned that the easiest and most effective way to define hese positive attributes is to look to others for feedback.

In order to collect the data necessary I sent an email to 20 people. I introduced the concept behind what I was doing and then asked for the following from each person:

> Please provide me with three examples of how I add value by completing the following statements&#8230;
> 
> One of the ways you add value and make important contributions is:
> 
> For example, I think of that time that:

In my case, 11 people responded with nearly 30 definite examples of me at my best. I found that the hardest part is then analyzing this data and really determining which traits best describe yourself.

&#8230;but it&#8217;s just as fun and rewarding to sift through emails reminding you how amazingly great you are.
