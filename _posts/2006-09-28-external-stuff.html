Not everything I do online ends up here on my blog so I figured I'd point to an article I wrote on <a href="http://yopos.com/2006/09/28/women-and-minority-entrepreneurs/">Women and Minority Entrepreneurs</a>, <a href="http://yopos.com/2006/09/27/rest-on-your-laurels/">resting on your laurels</a>, <a href="http://yopos.com/2006/09/20/your-priorities/">priorities</a>, and <a href="http://yopos.com/2006/09/15/can-entrepreneurship-be-taught/">whether entrepreneurship can be taught</a>. Additionally I've started a project documenting myself on video every day for 60 seconds. I'm on day five over at <a href="http://mindaverse.com/">Mind Averse</a>.
