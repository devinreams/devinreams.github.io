What do you do all day? That&#8217;s the question Noah [asked and answered][1]. I thought it might be fun to jot my schedule down and reflect.

<table width="500" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
      07:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Wake up, shower, dress. Occasionally make some toaster waffles.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      08:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      At my desk at work. Check email, do work, etc.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      09:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Grab a fruit and yogurt parfait at the cafeteria.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      13:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Head home for lunch, PB&#038;J.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      14:15
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Back to work. Occasional meeting.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      17:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Time to head home for the day. Change clothes, read email.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      18:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Grab some dinner, often includes going out to eat (Chipotle!)
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      18:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Work on side projects (yopos, Life With Women) and any work (<a href="http://www.b5media.com/">b5media</a>) I might need to do. Read. Blog.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      20:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Head to Lakeshore and play tennis, work out, sit in the whirlpool, etc.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      22:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Back home and time to watch some TV, relax, read.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      01:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Bed time! Might grab a cookie and milk before bed. ;-)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

So that&#8217;s it in a nutshell. Lots of my day is spent at work (intern, big telcom company). A few days a week I&#8217;ll also work at Six Flags at night&#8230; so 6:30-1:30 is spent at work. Long days for sure. Obviously my life isn&#8217;t as exciting as Noah&#8217;s, perhaps some day the world will overemploy me. For the time being, I&#8217;ll make some money with my internship (and 4 other jobs), go to class, and work on things online.

Now, if I had the **perfect schedule** it&#8217;d look more like:

<table width="500" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
      08:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Wake up, shower, dress. Make a nice breakfast (eggs, toast, cereal), watch some news or read the WSJ for a half hour or so..
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      08:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Start checking email, reading blogs, chatting with people.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      09:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Take a break and read a magazine or two in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/169119375/">massage chair</a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      10:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Back on the computer to work on stuff until lunch.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      12:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Lunch time.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      13:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Take a 90-minute nap. Yay <a href="http://devin.reams.me/2006/biphasic-sleep-update/">biphasic sleep</a>!
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      14:30
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Back up, rested and ready to work. Record my own version of Rocketboom/zeFrank.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      15:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Work on client work of some sort.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      18:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Done with work, time for dinner and some TV (Simpsons most likely).
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      19:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Listen to music, relax in the chair, read a book for an hour.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      20:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Off to the althetic club to workout, play tennis, whirlpool, shower, etc.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      22:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Back home, do a little work/email and get ready for sleep with TV, etc.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      02:00
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Sleep time!
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Maybe I need to start finding something I&#8217;m good at so I can do consulting! ;-)
