I&#8217;ve put it off for so long. I always know I need to get a shredder and start destroying some documents. With 2006 taxes coming up I have no need to hold onto 2005 pay stubs, I&#8217;ve already reconciled to my W-2s. I have no need to hang onto old University bills, credit card statements, etc. In fact, [here&#8217;s a guide on what you can trash][1]. But, before you put it out on the curb you should definitely look a little closer..

So, do what I did and head out to Target (Wal-Mart, Office Max, etc.) and pick up one of those simple paper shredder attachments. They sit right on top of your existing trash cash and get the job done.

I was scared to see the last four digits of my SSN showing up on pay stubs. With my name last four, and a little more work someone could probably get my wireless phone account, PayPal password reset, bank password, etc. Heck, with a bank statement you could probably verify my identity over the phone. You&#8217;ve heard of [pretexting][2] right?

My new shredder has given me peace of mind and more file cabinet space. So, what are you waiting for? It&#8217;ll probably cost you less than $15.

*Warning:* Be sure you only operate your shredder &#8220;one person at a time&#8221;. Muti-person simultaneous use is apparently a little-known hazard.
