It seems to be that time again: Valentine&#8217;s Day. The holiday most of us are forced to celebrate unwillingly. Why don&#8217;t we feel as compelled, if not more, to celebrate the useful holidays like Arbor Day? (Thanks, R).

So, despite Valentine&#8217;s Day being an overall bad thing we still have to deal with it. Even if it&#8217;s a slight gesture I&#8217;d wager you still do *something* on Valentines. If you&#8217;re one of the <strike>fortunate</strike> few that don&#8217;t: congratulations, you picked a good time to be single. Don&#8217;t feel left out, you&#8217;re one of the lucky escapees.

## So what do we do?

Since we&#8217;re forced to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; this holiday in some form or fashion we might as well do it with as little effort as possible, right? Don&#8217;t we always say it&#8217;s the thought that counts, anyway? With that said, there are two possible routes to go down.

## Be My Anti-Valentine

A clever site has been setup called [Be My Anti-Valentine][2] which allows you to send clever anti-Valentine cards to that special someone. Fellas, if you have a girl who appreciates this gesture&#8230; send her my number, you&#8217;ve got a keeper.

But really, if you&#8217;ve agreed that you don&#8217;t need to waste money on each other to remind yourselves how great you are to each other&#8230; then send a funny card.

## Valentine Gift Finder

Or, if you&#8217;re like the other 99.9% of the nation, you&#8217;ll end up deciding now is a good time to let someone know you&#8217;re still there and you still care. You may go out to dinner, you might even cook it yourself. Some send cards, others send flowers. Me? I&#8217;m a fan of thoughtful, relevant gifts. Sure, chocolate is a given, but wouldn&#8217;t you like to find a gift that always reminds your special someone of you?

Well, the folks at [Imagini have created an excellent gift finder][3] designed to help us out. In fact, you simply send a quick picture-based questionnaire to your better-half and you&#8217;ll have a great list of gifts narrowed down in no-time. In fact, I&#8217;ve used it and I was impressed with the results (yes, I purchased a gift this way). It&#8217;s quick, easy, and makes things a bit more relevant.

## Good luck

So, with 9 days left you should probably get moving. Which route are you taking? Card? Gift? Dinner? None of the above?
