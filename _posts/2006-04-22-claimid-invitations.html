The first two people to use <a href="http://claimid.com/register?key=d01ee6122f8734b5202473d512412ed64b0869a5">this link</a> will be able to register a <a href="http://claimid.com/about">claimID beta</a> account. It's sorta dumb but sorta useful. I'll play with it a bit more. At first glance, it does little more than my <a href="http://devinreams.com/about/">About</a> page.. but I realize not everyone out there has an <a href="http://devinreams.com/about/">About</a> page.
