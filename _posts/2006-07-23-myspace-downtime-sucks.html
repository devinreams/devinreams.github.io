The dipthongs over at the world's shittiest website, MySpace, have had the site inoperable/down since 6:30PST, it is now over 5 hours later and nothing is fixed. Needless to say, my site has received a lot of visits/comments on MySpace downtime from kids wondering whats up. Who's going to make the MySpace killer? Just import people's profile and friends (reserve a spot for them by email address until they make it over) and transfer all that information, it'd be genuis. MySpace doesn't deserve a second (or 22nd for those of you keeping track) chance...
