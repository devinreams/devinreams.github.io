*You may not know this about me but I like to experiment with technology. I try different things in order to better an aspect of my life, no matter how minor. This is one of those examples&#8230;*

As I&#8217;ve been struggling with which web browser to use full time (Safari is ahead of Chrome, but Firefox is necessary for Firebug), I&#8217;ve also struggled with how to keep my bookmarks organized and in-sync across all devices and all browsers. Nothing annoyed me more than getting &#8220;focused&#8221; in one browser but realizing I can&#8217;t load up a page I was thinking of because it wasn&#8217;t bookmarked over here.

And by &#8220;bookmarked&#8221; I don&#8217;t mean a funny article about Sarah Palin like what I&#8217;ve been keeping in [pinboard][1], I&#8217;m talking about those frequently-visited sites and actions (bookmarklets) that I want to quickly access from [launchbar][2] and the [awesomebar][3]: email, calendar, task list, billing system, client websites, personal finance websites, instruction guides, social websites, online utilities, and so on.

### [Xmarks][4]

This thing is stupid simple: install the browser-specific plugins, create an account and you&#8217;re done. It runs in the background and I&#8217;ve never noticed it. I&#8217;ve installed Xmarks on my Macbook Air for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox and everything is always up-to-date, no conflicts, no trouble.

This is especially handy since I can transition from one browser to the other and use the address bar the same way: type a few characters of a word, select the website I meant, and hit go. This quick, fluid motion is valuable when visiting thousands of websites each and every day. But, here&#8217;s where it gets interesting&#8230;

### [MobileMe][6]

Arguably, the biggest time suck in my life is typing on an iOS device. I&#8217;m fine at the typing, but I use my iPad and iPhone almost exclusively at home. So, it annoys me to no end to try and type in a long website address with two thumbs.

Though, when a website is saved as a bookmark, the address bar will surface it to you immediate as you start typing. Much like any other address bar, this means I can type just a few characters and almost immediately tap to go. No more &#8220;fiacardservices.com&#8221; typos anymore! No more &#8220;google.com/webmasters/tools&#8221; marathon sessions.

But, how do I get all those bookmarks from my web browsers onto two more Apple devices? Easy: I pay the $99 subscription fee for MobileMe (get 30% off if you ask nicely at an Apple Store). Then, I spent 5 minutes configuring my iOS devices and personal computer settings. That&#8217;s it.

Now when I add a new bookmark \*anywhere\*, I don&#8217;t even have to think about it. It shows up everywhere wirelessly and effortlessly. (Sidenote: I think Apple will do very well when it adds more cloud-based offerings to MobileMe, this stuff &#8220;just works&#8221;).

Has anyone experimented with anything else?
