I?d like to revisit my desk briefly while I show you my decorative space-saver. As mentioned, I call it my ?phone tree? and you can see it here:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/84290671/"><img width="194" height="259" border="0" title="Phone Tree" alt="Phone Tree" src="http://static.flickr.com/37/84290671_4c57d7e14f.jpg?v=0" /></a>
</div>

The following elements are necessary to ensure a successful ?phone tree?:

*   **Decorative flora placed on a surface:** A quick google search for ?<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=eJC&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;safe=off&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&#038;q=small+artificial+tree+-christmas&#038;btnG=Search">small artificial tree -christmas</a>? turned up some nice looking trees and plants. From a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.earthflora.com/store/cart.php?target=product&#038;product_id=20172&#038;category_id=934">little fern</a> to a [small cherry blossom tree][1] I?m sure you can find a nice looking plant to tuck your phone into at any local hobby store as well.
*   **Phone charger discreetly hidden into the plant:** When not in use you don?t want an unsightly cable pertruding. You?re clever, find a cool way to hide it in there.
*   **Headset or similar accessory/ies that may also keep a low profile: **As you can see on my tree I can just lay the headset over the tree ?leaves? and it blends right in. In addition, I set my lint-free wipe cloth on the base. Now I can talk to people and use my freed-up hands to clean off smudges!

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my ideas as much as I have. The tree is not only decorative but practical. If you decide to make your own tree be sure to leave a link in the comments.
