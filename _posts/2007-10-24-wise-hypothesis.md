From a wise guy I know (those that share our own beliefs are often viewed as wise):

> If you believe the stereotype that &#8220;Eastern&#8221; minds (Chinese in particular) are better at math than occidental minds, and math is the basis of the technology which moves information, and access to information is the basis for economic power, then the 21st century will see the economic ascension of the Chinese economy, and the setting of the U.S.

Among many other factors, yes, there will be setting.
