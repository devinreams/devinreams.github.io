[Andre][1] wrote [an interesting article on naming products][2] yesterday. This is where I step in and argue the opposite: *names don&#8217;t matter*.

I was talking with [Chris][3] one morning and we stumbled into an interesting discussion. **What do you think of when you hear of some famous company names for the first time?**

*   **Burger King and McDonalds** &#8211; If you heard these two for the first time which would make you think &#8216;delicious&#8217; and which would make you think tools or something?
*   **Maceys and Forbes** &#8211; Would you know the difference between a clothing store and a business magazine? Using a last name tells me nothing about a company. **Wal-Mart** and **Sam&#8217;s Club** are awesome extensions of Sam Walton&#8217;s name.
*   **General Motors, Ford, Toyota** &#8211; Hmm, I&#8217;d think General Motors is probably something to do with motors. Cars though? Perhaps. Ford and Toyota? No way.
*   **Safeway** &#8211; First aid? Airbag manufacturer?
*   **Flickr** &#8211; Something to do with light. A camera flash.
*   **meebo** &#8211; Something about myself but I&#8217;d never think instant messaging.
*   **Pandora** &#8211; Something bad, cluttered, uncontrollable. Wow, isn&#8217;t it all about the opposite?
*   **Google -** I know everyone in elementary school was fascinated by the word &#8216;googolplex&#8217; I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d think of &#8220;a lot&#8221; and maybe math. Search, though? Never.
*   **OK Dork**- Uh&#8230;.

It&#8217;s amazing how many companies actually use family names. Check out the [Fortune 100][4] list: Wells Fargo, Sears, McKesson, Morgan Stanley, Time Warner, Walgreens, Lockheed Martin, Lowes, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Merrill Lynch, Walt Disney, etc.

So, when you&#8217;re spending hours coming up with a name for your new company, product, service or feature maybe it&#8217;s not worth your time. If it&#8217;s good the name will follow&#8230;

Feel free to prove me wrong&#8230;
