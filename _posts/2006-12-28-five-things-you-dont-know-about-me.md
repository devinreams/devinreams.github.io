Well, it&#8217;s finally happened, [Glenn Wolsey][1] and [Ralph Dagza][2] &#8216;tagged&#8217; me in the &#8220;Things you don&#8217;t know about me&#8221; meme. I think this one can be fun if I put some thought into it. After some time I&#8217;ve come up with the following. Friends new and old may all surprised by my personal trivia.

<!--more-->

## 1. I was adopted

This is the one thing people usually second guess. But, it&#8217;s true, I was adopted when I was born. I haven&#8217;t met my biological parents and I don&#8217;t plan on it.

## 2. I always try to do math in my head

It may sound weird but in class I almost test myself. When teachers start writing accounting problems there may be a number that needs to be solved for. I try to come up with it before she can even read her own notes and write it down.

## 3. I am extremely indifferent

If there is a decision to be made, I won&#8217;t make it. Either way I will be content. Where do we want to eat? I don&#8217;t care. Which ski run should we go down now? They&#8217;re all good to me. I&#8217;m not trying to be difficult, I&#8217;m just easy to please I guess. If I have an opinion on something there&#8217;s no way you could miss it.

## 4. I want to be a CEO

Not of any ol&#8217; company- I want to run a huge one. I want to be busy, travel, go to lots of meetings, and oversee something big. Maybe for the money, maybe for the fast lifestyle, maybe for the responsibility, who knows.

## 5. I don&#8217;t enjoy cooking

Unless there is someone there with me it can be fun. But, overall, I find the time cooking and consuming food to be almost wasteful. This is why I always try to do something else while eating (watch TV, meet with a friend, read email).

So, there you have it. You may think I&#8217;m weired(er) having read that but it&#8217;s just a little more insight into yours truly. Personally, I want [Tyme][3] to give us her responses. Oh, and [David][4], too.**
