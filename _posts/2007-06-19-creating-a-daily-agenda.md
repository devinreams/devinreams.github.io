One of the most useful habits I&#8217;ve begun is very simple. It&#8217;s helped me accomplish more each day. It&#8217;s helped me feel accomplished before I go to bed. The best part about this technique? There are only three steps!

## 1. Create your daily list

I use my BlackBerry Tasks application to dump every single task I think of. You can do the same with a piece of paper, whiteboard, etc. Just <span class="highlight">jot down every thing that comes up</span>.

If it needs to be done in a week, put it down. If it needs to be done in a few hours, put it down. Now we have a list!

## 2. Pick today&#8217;s tasks

At this point I know what I need to do. I can simply pick out the tasks I want to get done tomorrow. If the day is looking slow I&#8217;d better come up with some things that will make me feel effective. I want to look at my accomplishments and <span class="highlight">know the day was well spent</span>.

Once I have my major tasks planned out I simply head to bed. I have tomorrows quasi-agenda laid out on my phone/sticky note/whiteboard.

## 3. Wake up, get moving, skip email

<span class="highlight">Email will throw a wrench in whatever best laid plans you&#8217;ve put together</span>. Sure, you can get your Daily Dilbert fix but don&#8217;t address anything else. By mid-day (lunch-ish) I do a status check. I see where I am with my list and by then, everyone else has woken up and filled my inbox. So, take a break, check your emails and see if there&#8217;s anything else that needs to be done by end-of-day (be sure to add it to the list!).

## This really helps

The last few days I&#8217;ve started doing this have been productive. People will admit that email commonly controls their lives and daily agenda. Breaking away from it will let you do what *you* want to do for the day.

Just try it out. Skipping email in the morning keeps you focused and, I promise, you won&#8217;t miss much.
