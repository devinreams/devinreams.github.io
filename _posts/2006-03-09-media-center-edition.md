Despite popular belief, television is still great and still *very* alive. Sure, technology and the internet are awesome. But what I&#8217;ve found to be more awesome is the combination of the two. Windows Media Center Edition brings my TV to my computer. No longer do I need two seperate screens in my room (hah, [but I do][1] anyway). I just pull up Media Center and can tune into my cable TV. Besides, I watch the History Channel like it&#8217;s my job and I&#8217;m glad I can take screenshots from Modern Marvels:

  <a title="Modern Marvels" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/109874611/"><img width="240" height="177" border="0" alt="Modern Marvels" src="http://static.flickr.com/36/109874611_139873b3fd_m.jpg" /></a>

In fact, I use Media Center to watch TV more than I use my bigscreen. Why? For beginners, MCE downloads program data into the &#8216;Guide&#8217;. When we had basic cable I had to sit and watch the TV Guide channel for 10 minutes before I realized there was absolutely nothing on. MCE let&#8217;s me search and sort by genre (Movie, Children, etc).

My favorite feature is the ability to record shows. I have a bunch of storage space (about 250g) and I have no problem finding space to record three or four different programs each day. The best part is I can Suspend the computer and it will automatically wake itself up to record shows when I&#8217;m not around.

[<img width="100" height="76" border="0" align="right" alt="Media Center Pictures" src="http://static.flickr.com/44/110253865_30a2eca18e_t.jpg" />][2]I&#8217;ve also found Media Center&#8217;s &#8216;My Pictures&#8217; to be a great feature. I can watch professional looking slideshows with no effort at all. It&#8217;s also simple enough to play music in the background. When you&#8217;ve got a nice looking slideshow all you need to do is then hit the &#8216;Burn&#8217; button and you&#8217;re good to go.

But, some of my favorite features are found under the &#8216;Online Spotlight&#8217; section. Here I can pull up MTV&#8217;s Overdrive and watch music videos, on demand, with my remote. I can visit Comedy Central&#8217;s channel and watch clips. Even the Associated Press has news clips and a scrolling news ticker.

If Media Center&#8217;s Music capabilities were a bit better (it doesn&#8217;t handle my 12,000 MP3s very well) then I&#8217;d really have no reason to ever close the window. So, to recap, **Media Center is the best because:**

*   Screenshots,
*   Built in TV guide,
*   Record shows (and even entire series),
*   Picture slide shows,
*   Online Spotlight, and
*   [MCE remote][3] and [keyboard][4]

In short, I don&#8217;t think most people realize how useful Media Center Edition is. I use it constantly and can&#8217;t picture myself having another computer without it. I&#8217;m sure [Nathan][5] would agree.
