You wouldn&#8217;t know that we were skiing just a few weeks ago looking at the ground in the mountains. Everything is brown, melting, and dry. Which is good if you want to hike (bad if you want to ski).

We did some hiking in the hills in Breckenridge. On one trail we wandered onto some old mining land and found some remnants.
