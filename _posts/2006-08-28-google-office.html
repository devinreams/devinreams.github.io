Um, hi everyone. I've been using these 'hosted applications' for months now. My life revolves around hosted <a href="http://gmail.google.com/hosted/devinreams.com">GMail</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/hosted/devinreams.com/render">Calendar</a> for <a href="http://devinreams.com/">devinreams.com</a>. So, why are we all getting excited over this? Oh, right, becase it's Google. Slow news day I guess.
