Whoops, it&#8217;s already February. I have no idea how time has flown this fast but it has. As I get older the more I understand the phrase &#8220;Time is relevant&#8221;. The more time I&#8217;ve experienced, the less it takes to pass in the future.

Honestly, as another week passes I wonder &#8220;What did I accomplish?&#8221; With only 52 in a year I&#8217;d like to think I can come up with 52 solid accomplishments pretty easily. So, with that said, I will try to sum the week up into my single accomplishment:

## I broke a ski pole

I figured my week was all for naught but then Sunday came around and brought me excitement. Let me give you some context: nearly every time I go skiing I decide to turn off my &#8216;rational&#8217; section of my brain. I go do silly things that I probably shouldn&#8217;t. Today was one of those days.

In the past I&#8217;ve done some pretty amazing things. Heres one day at the ski jump and another having finished a make-out session with my ski&#8217;s edge.

Today I decided to one-up myself. I was going through a semi-forested run and ended up getting my right pole stuck in a tree branch. It grabbed on and didn&#8217;t let go. I, on the other hand, was going quickly past it &#8212; also not giving up the pole. This force twisted me oh-so-slightly off course. My right ski got stuck in powder but with my forward momentum I kept going&#8230; head first. I ended up in a huge drift of powder. The drift turns out to be a dry creek bed.

So, the pole was bent, to say the least. I went to oh-so-slightly bend it back into place when it snapped.

So I skied all day with one pole (after holding a proper burial, of course). I figured I should hang onto the survivor.

## Other happenings&#8230;

More conference stuff. More school. I forgot my laptop on Thursday. Apparently class is a lot longer when you don&#8217;t have a laptop. I also met [Ben][1]; cool guy, tall, smart, knows his sushi.
