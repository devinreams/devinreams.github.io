I submitted my site to be considered in the 4th round of applicants to <a href="http://www.9rules.com/">9rules</a>. Everyone who applied should comment/trackback here so I can make sure my site is better than yours... err, so we can all check each other's sites out (because face it, not everyone will get in).
