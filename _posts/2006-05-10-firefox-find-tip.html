If you want to quikcly search for something on a page you can simply type '/' and it will pull up the 'Find' toolbar. If you've ever had to search a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_pages">man page</a> you shouldn't have a problem understanding this one. I used to have the option 'Begin finding when you begin typing' enabled but that quickly annoyed me when I'd accidently hit a letter and loose my place while reading.
