Everything is relative. I&#8217;ve been conducting an informal survey for a little while now: when I ask for &#8216;lots and lots of ketchup&#8217; at the Chik-Fil-A drive-through I will receive either a) lots and lots of ketchup or b) three or four packets. The determining factor: how busy the Chik-Fil-A is. Something tells me if you work there and you hand out a dozen packets to a dozen cars in 5 minutes in a row you seem like you&#8217;re giving away too much. But, give away a dozen packets to a dozen cars in 30 minutes and you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re supposed to. (I think I&#8217;ll start saying &#8216;fill the bag with ketchup&#8217;.)
