Denver friends, you&#8217;re cordially invited to a viewing party at the Crowd Favorite offices this Thursday. The excellent [Passion Projects][1] talk series presented by GitHub (to surface and celebrate women in technology) will be live-streamed.

Hurry and [register now][2] to watch Leslie Bradshaw&#8217;s talk. It should be excellent but we have limited space available.
