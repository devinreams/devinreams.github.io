I&#8217;ve started what I call my &#8216;PIP&#8217; or &#8216;Personal Improvement Project&#8217;. The new year has sparked a lot of change already. So far I&#8217;ve dropped BusinessBits, established my own domain and completely reorganized my workspace.

But now I&#8217;m on to bigger things.

As mentioned the other day, I&#8217;ve started a [biphasic sleep schedule][1]. I went to sleep two nights ago at 1am (in order to ween myself into it) and woke up at 6. Last night I napped from 8:30p-10p &#8230; and then again from 10:03-midnight. Oops. I think my body doesn&#8217;t yet realize what I&#8217;m doing, which is fine&#8230; I expected this. Anyway, I got up at midnight, got some things done and went back to bed at 2. This morning I was back up at 6. I plan to try the nap again tonight.

My ultimate goal is to get through four sleep cycles each day. This means I hit REM sleep three times at night and then once during my nap. I wake up immediately after the cycle is complete. Now, I&#8217;ve read that most people&#8217;s cycles are about 90 minutes long but it looks like mine are only about 75 minutes long. I&#8217;ve discovered this now having looked back at the two times I woke up without an alarm. Going back to my goal, four cycles equates to five hours of sleep. From what I&#8217;ve read, this could be more than plenty.

So, I&#8217;m going to adjust a bit and see how things go. Technically I&#8217;m on my second day and I&#8217;m not feeling tired or anything.
