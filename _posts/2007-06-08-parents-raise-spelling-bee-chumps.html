I took a class at CU called "School and Society." We discussed home schooling and how the largest argument against the kids being anti-social is the fact they spend time with others in the community.. ie: Spelling Bees. <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/video/2862093">This interesting video</a> encompasses a lot of what I've thought about home schooled children: 1) they don't know how to be social, 2) they believe they are better than other kids, and 3) they think competing with peers is suitable interaction. The best part? It's not really their fault. I think a lot of parents are doing their children a huge disservice. When you raise kids they believe what you say; they see what you show them and learn what you teach them. Education, religion, values... wow. It's not until many many years later you get to decide this stuff for yourself. That was a fun realization.
