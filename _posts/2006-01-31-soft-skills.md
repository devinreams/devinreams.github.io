[Dave][1] points to a great article from Fortune on soft skills: [The war for top executive talent][2]. The consulting group I work for actually provides classroom based soft-skill training to large (Fortune 500) companies. Interesting quote: *&#8220;Ask your company&#8217;s best leaders to name the most powerful learning experiences they&#8217;ve had.&#8221; They will hardly ever mention a class and will almost always name a real-life experience in business. The challenge is to find ways to replicate those experiences.&#8221;*
