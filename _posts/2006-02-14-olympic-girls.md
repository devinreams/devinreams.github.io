This may just be the Valentine&#8217;s Day talking but is it me or does the United States have some of the [prettiest competitors][1] [in the world][2]? It&#8217;s that &#8216;girl-next-door&#8217; mixed with the &#8216;best-on-the-planet&#8217; look that really struck me today&#8230; and if you&#8217;re wondering, I plan on eating ice cream and watching The Notebook alone tomorrow night.
