I went skiing today and would like to point out that I've been on the <a href="http://breckenridge.snow.com/info/winter/newlift.asp">highest chair lift in North America</a>. It brought us to nearly 13,000 feet. The wind was crazy but the view was spectacular. In order to construct it they used a helicopter that could lift up to 10 tons of steel (at sea level). They have a video on their site. In any case, if you felt extra-ambitious you could hike up to the very top of the peak and ski down some other bowls... I'll just say that getting to the top was enough excitement for me today.
