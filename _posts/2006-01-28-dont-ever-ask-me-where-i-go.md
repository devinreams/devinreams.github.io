This is a dual-purpose post. First, my song of the day is called &#8216;Hardcore Days &#038; Softcore Nights&#8217; by Aqueduct. It&#8217;s a really neat song but unfortunately the lyrics didn&#8217;t turn up on Google at all. I knew I had the song, but couldn&#8217;t find it! So, if you&#8217;re looking for a catchy indie song that repeats &#8220;don&#8217;t ever ask me where I go&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t ever ask me where I&#8217;m from&#8221;, this is your song.
