Ben Casnocha has written [a book][1] about, you guessed it, his start-up life. Being that he&#8217;s only 19 I wonder what other &#8216;lives&#8217; he&#8217;ll be having. In any case, Ben&#8217;s a smart guy. Check out his blog and [his book, My Start-Up Life][1]: &#8220;The book is my own story of entrepreneurship written in way that can inspire and aid other entrepreneurs to start their own businesses, or simply become CEO of their own lives. In addition, guest essays by distinguished business leaders offer an interesting perspective on the ideas I present.&#8221; Learn more at: <http://www.mystartuplife.com>.
