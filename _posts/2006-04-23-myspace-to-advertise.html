<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/business/yourmoney/23myspace.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5088&en=68144371c2be06ac&ex=1303444800&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">Interesting article on how MySpace is thinking about... gasp... making money through advertising.</a> Good thought! Their revolutionary thinking has essentially taken what Facebook has already done... and made it uglier... probably with music playing in the background: <em>"To expand ad sales ... [MySpace] plans to [turn] advertisers into members of the MySpace community, with their own profiles, like the teenagers' ? so that the young people who often spend hours each day on MySpace can become "friends" with movies, cellphone companies and even deodorants. Young people can link to the profiles set up for these goods and services, as they would to real friends, and these commercial "friends" can even send them messages ? ads, really...."</em> Yeah, that'll fly. "I can't wait to add my deodorant to my friend list!" Jackasses.
