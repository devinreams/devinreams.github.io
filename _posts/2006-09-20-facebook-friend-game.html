Hey Facebook fans, are you <em>really</em> friends with your "friends"? If not why the heck do you have them listed as one? In any case, test your true friend knowledge with the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/friend_game.php">Facebook Friend Game</a>. Found under 'My Friends' as a tab at the top. I'm kinda bad at this!
