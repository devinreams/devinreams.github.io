<p><strong>Senate says English is national, unifying tongue</strong><br />
The Senate agreed on Thursday to make English the national language of the United States and moments later also adopted a milder alternative calling English the country's "unifying language." (<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060519/pl_nm/usa_immigration_language_dc">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Wow, now people can't keep touting that stupid "there is no national langue" argument. Well... if it makes it all the way through the House.</p>
