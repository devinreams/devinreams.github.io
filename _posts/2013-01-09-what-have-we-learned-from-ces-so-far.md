I think the list is short but these shouldn&#8217;t be surprises, right?

1.  A chipmaker — always at least one degree removed from consumers — [is out of touch][1] with what gets consumers excited about electronics&#8230; at the Consumer Electronics Show.

2.  [3D television is dead][2] to consumers &#8230; because it was only pushed by manufacturers and studios to sell more electronics and movies?

Serious question: what comes out of CES anymore?

Stay tuned for my snarky coverage of SXSW&#8230;
