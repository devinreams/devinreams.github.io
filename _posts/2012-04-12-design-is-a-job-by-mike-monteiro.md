I just finished reading Mike Monteiro&#8217;s book: [Design Is a Job][1]. As a principal at Mule Design for over ten years, Mike has a lot of great experience and much of what he said elicited severe head nodding and a me-too&#8217;ing. This book is a great roadmap of the things I&#8217;ve learned working with [Alex][2] and the team at [Crowd Favorite][3] for the past 3 years. I&#8217;d say anyone in the web design and development industry should take look at this book. It&#8217;s a quick read (finished it in a couple hours) and extremely insightful into the &#8220;business side&#8221; of web design at a small firm.
