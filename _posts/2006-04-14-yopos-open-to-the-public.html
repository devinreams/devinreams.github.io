I've decided to open up the <a href="http://yopos.com/">yopos network</a> (young professionals) to applicants. Originally we were an invitation-only group with big ideas. I decided we'd get more out of yopos if it became a community. More details are on <a href="http://www.yopos.com/?p=10">the blog</a>.

As of right now we have a <a href="http://yopos.com/forum">forum</a> and introductions are under-way. I can't wait to get people actively involved. Perosonally, I have a few ideas I'd like to see in place... I just need some help.

Take a look at yopos and if it appears to be a group you can relate to then, by all means, leave a comment or shoot an email.
