From the [Forecast Blog][1]:

> &#8230;if it looks and feels like an app, and lives on your home screen, it’s an App. With a capital “A.” I’d go as far as to say the [best weather App][2] in the world right now is a web app. I may be biased, of course, but the fact that Forecast is even a contender is kind of a big deal. It raises the question: why aren’t there more high quality mobile web apps that have the look, feel, and performance of their native counterparts?

Some of my favorite apps are &#8220;just&#8221; web apps or bookmarked mobile sites on my home screen: [Forecast][2], [COTrip][3], [OpenSnow][4], TestFlight, [GameTonight][5], [Untappd][6], Techmeme and on and on.

I don&#8217;t know many folks outside the web industry that realize this is a feature. I hope apps like Forecast continue to pave the way&#8230;
