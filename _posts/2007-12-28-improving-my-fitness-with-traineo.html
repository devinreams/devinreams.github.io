I've decided it was time to focus a bit more on my personal health including my diet and exercise:

<ul><li><strong>First Step: Joined a gym since moving.</strong> I've paid for the membership which allows me M/W/F/Sun access. I also scheduled 9-10pm on my calendar so that I keep it on my radar.</li>
<li><strong>Second Step: Paid attention to what I eat.</strong> I've created my <a href="http://www.traineo.com">traineo</a> <a href="http://www.traineo.com/devinreams">account</a> in order to track my diet (both quality and quantity). I use <a href="http://www.fitday.com">FitDay</a> to quickly reference what kinds of calories I'm really eating.</li>
<li><strong>Third Step: Paid attention to my activities.</strong> I've never really been aware of how active I am but by using traineo I can start to chart and improve my weekly workouts.</li>
</ul>

It's not revolutionary but I've realized just being more aware of something can help you on your way to improving it.
