Six months ago I [joined](https://github.com/blog/1748-devin-reams-is-a-githubber) the impressive team at [GitHub](https://github.com/about/). Since I haven't publicly shared much about my experiences yet I wanted to take the opportunity to reflect on my latest chapter.

### What is GitHub?

<div style="float:right"><img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" width="250px"></div>GitHub's goal is to help individuals and organizations build better software, together. We do this by providing tools that enable teams to collaborate quickly and easily, and produce higher-quality results than possible with other tools and philosophies. We use GitHub to build GitHub.

Our roots are based in the open source community but we also understand very large organizations (and their workflows, needs, challenges, benefits, etc.).

Of the 240-or-so of us, the majority work remotely and do not live in San Francisco.

We have a unique mascot, the "Octocat" :octocat: which is an octopus and a cat. We turn it into all kinds of fun [characters](https://octodex.github.com/), [t-shirts, and stickers](https://shop.github.com/). We also use emoji a lot. :grin: :thumbsup:

### Why GitHub?

I'm glad you asked! I've dabbled in web development and design for over a decade and worked with open source technologies like [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) for many years now. Shortly after GitHub appeared in 2007 it became _the_ location for many great open source projects. It was also a beautiful website with powerful features amongst a landscape of dull interfaces and online experiences.

I created a [GitHub.com account](https://github.com/devinreams) back in 2008 and didn't do much with it. As I collaborated with clients that hosted their own projects privately on GitHub I realized that I had only seen the tip of the iceberg: many individuals and organizations were working together on GitHub and I started to see its amazing.

### How did you get a job at GitHub?

I've had an "internet friend", @bleikamp, for many years that I met through [Noah Kagan](https://okdork.com/). I also followed @kneith who was a prominent designer and a member of the [9rules](http://9rules.com) community. In the back of my mind I knew they both were doing cool stuff at GitHub.

I happened to be in San Francisco last summer for [a conference](http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/) and invited myself to visit the GitHub offices (HQ 2.0). Ben obliged and after chatting (and walking away with a nice t-shirt) my interest in GitHub was re-ignited :fire:.

A few days later I was browsing the ["About" page](https://github.com/about/) on GitHub.com and spotted an open position for a "Technical Account Manager". After reading it I realized the description was a lot of what I was doing at [Crowd Favorite](http://devin.reams.me/2014/the-end-of-chapter-1-my-fond-farewell-to-crowd-favorite/). I asked Ben if he'd be willing to pass my name along to the right folks and he happily did.

After answering a dozen written questions—actual inquiries from existing or potential customers—I was invited to do a series of phone :phone: interviews. From there I was asked to come :airplane: to San Francisco and spend a day at the office. I really enjoyed meeting and talking with a bunch of GitHubbers (@danishkhan, @dsorkin, @leereiley, @lizclink, @jessla, @pmn, @sachinr). I never felt uncomfortable or extremely nervous during the day but I did feel like we would be a great fit for each other.

Luckily, they agreed. I was offered the position a week later, picked a January start date and went into the holiday season ready to relax and wind things down at [Crowd Favorite](http://crowdfavorite.com/).

### Are you a developer at GitHub?

No, I'm part of the "sales and account management" team at GitHub. There are about a dozen of us within the 240 person organization. Our primary goal is to help organizations bring GitHub to work.

For some groups, that simply means we help make sure buyers or managers at larger organizations understand the ins-and-outs and pros and cons of purchasing an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/), our hosted "SaaS" product that most folks know as "GitHub".

The majority of our team and time is actually focused on helping customers that want to bring GitHub into their own datacenters. [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/) is our on-premises product that is essentially the same as GitHub.com but limited to just your employees and the software is installed on your own servers.

Externally, I talk to prospective customers about everything from pricing, to the competitive landscape, through proposed workflows, and sometimes simply how to complete a purchase. I jump on the phone to answer questions, draft thousand-word emails describing why GitHub may be their best solution, and even respond to questionnaires with hundreds of items to help organizations understand the impact of installing GitHub Enterprise in their environment. I also travel to meet and speak with prospective and existing customers to understand their software development and collaborative processes better.

Internally, I sometimes help our team spot patterns and wordsmith high-quality responses to our customers. I work with our account managers to lend some technical "backup" when speaking with customers. I sometimes serve as a liaison to other teams at GitHub to lend perspective from our customers (marketing, engineering) or from ourselves (finance). Sometimes I simply take :pencil: notes during meetings, make checklists, ask questions, or start discussions to help keep our team informed or organized.

In the near future I plan to travel to conferences and meet with more customers and folks that may not have even heard of GitHub.

### Do you work in San Francisco?

Nope, [both Rachel and I](http://devinandrachel.com/) grew up in Colorado and really like it here. Since GitHub is a global organization with employees and customers all over the world, I asked to see if it would make sense to make our first "sales team" hire outside of San Francisco. I made the argument that by having more remote employees on our team we could start to understand if we have any gaps in our communication and collaboration process and build best practices around working with team members in different locations and timezones.

Six months in this "experiment" has been a great success. As more members of our team travel to meet with customers or go abroad to conferences, some of the new behaviors we've introduced (and bad ones we've stopped) have allowed us to work and make decisions asynchronously; all while still providing great customer service.

### What is it like working from home?

It's great! Sure, I can spend more time at home being productive and I'm also afforded the flexibility to run an errand during the day. But, I also need to consciously separate work from home time and go out of my way to remain socially  connected to my team members all around the world.

Luckily, GitHub has a great culture and remote employees are not second-class citizens. We have folks dedicated to making sure our "distributed" needs are taken care of (everything from office supplies through feeling isolated) and a team dedicated to audio/visual technology including videocameras in conference rooms and live streaming our all-hands and important meetings.

It takes some work on both sides, and it's not for everyone, but I've found it easy to work from home. Written communication becomes paramount to success.

We use chat to stay in touch with everyone throughout the day, GitHub repositories to capture decisions and discussions, our ticketing system to communicate with customers or capture notes from discussions, video calls to have high-bandwidth conversations with each other, and phone calls and screensharing to speak with prospective and current customers.

### Do you travel much?

Sometimes! I visit HQ 3.0 once every month or so. We have a semi-regular team meeting to have high-bandwith discussions about pressing issues, big decisions, new initiatives and anything else anyone else would like to add to our agenda.

It's sometimes tough to be away from Rachel for a week but it's fun because I get to be social with my team: we play pool, go to lunch and dinner, have a drink :cocktail: together, and hang out and chat on our rooftop.

I also go meet with customers (I [visited Tokyo](http://devin.reams.me/2014/tokyo-photos/) :tokyo_tower: in May) and have the opportunity to go to conferences to help with a trade show booth or give a talk.

### What is HQ 3.0?

This is what we call GitHub's (current) [official headquarters](http://www.wired.com/2013/09/github-office/), the third iteration, located in downtown San Francisco. It's a couple blocks from the baseball :baseball: stadium in South Beach and was designed by some key :octocat:s to encourage collaboration and have a great gathering space for us, our friends, and the community. We have all the expected "startup" perks: a nice big dining area, DJ booth, pool table, standing desks, bouncing balls, quirky conference rooms, video games, snacks, and a big beautiful rooftop deck looking out towards the bay and the Bay Bridge.

If you happen to visit San Francisco and would like to visit, even if it's just to sit somewhere quiet with wifi, send me an email: [mailto:devin@github.com](devin@github.com).

Also be sure to follow [our blog](https://github.com/blog/category/drinkup) to learn about community events in San Francisco and around the world.
