Tis the season where family and friends start asking the dreaded: what do you want for Christmas? My parents finally dropped it on me. I was actually talking to Rachel about this and she made a very excellent point:

> At this stage in my life I don&#8217;t need more &#8220;things.&#8221; I&#8217;m at a stage where I value experiences over things.

Brilliant. As a student of the uber-successful [Tim Ferriss][2] I agree entirely that I&#8217;d much rather a few bucks towards a ski-trip in Canada over a few bucks towards a new suit.

In twenty years am I going to look back and remember how nice that jacket looked? No, I&#8217;ll stop and remember the great time I had in Bamf. Besides, our society defines gifts as expected and necessary. That defeats the purpose to me.

Besides, we have too much stuff anyway. This year I&#8217;m going to ask someone to donate to a cause in my name or sponsor my upcoming adventure. That sounds like a pretty good wishlist to me.
