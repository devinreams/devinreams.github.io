Exciting news for [b5media][1] and [9rules][2]. I&#8217;ll be chastised for putting the two companies in the same sentence but that&#8217;s alright. b5media, one of my employers, [raised $2 million][3] in VC funding. 9rules, some of my best internet pals, has received some [tasty cookies][4] for all their great work. I don&#8217;t know which of these two rewards took more work&#8230;
