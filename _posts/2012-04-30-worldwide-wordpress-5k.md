The folks at Automattic (who run WordPress.com) schedule an [annual 5K run/walk][1]. Not the kind where everyone shows up at the same place but one that is scheduled simultaneously around the world for everyone to participate in.

During this worldwide 5k week I participated in two:

## 1. Weekly Running Club

Every Tuesday the [Denver Beer Co.][2] hosts a running club where nearly a hundred folks all take off and run a 5k together around the Confluence Park area. Rachel and I plan to be there every week if possible.

## 2. March of Dimes

Every year Rachel and I walk with a family friend at the March of Dimes and this past Saturday it was at City Park in Denver. It was a great way to spend an early weekend morning.

I&#8217;ve become more and more accustomed to running over the years (and [Nike Running][3] is a fascinating athletics-turned-technology company story) so I hope to document more of these over time.
