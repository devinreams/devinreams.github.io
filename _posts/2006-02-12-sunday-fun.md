Monday is near. I found [this video][1] and it reminded me that college isn&#8217;t so bad. You get to find some *real* talent. Anyway, you&#8217;ll probably enjoy the video. Deep down I, too, am a white kid with a guitar singing a collection of rap songs. Personally, I would&#8217;ve thrown some Sean Paul in&#8230;
