That was a nice little break. It was becoming pretty hard to come up with new stuff every day. I don't know what pace I'll resume at, so, we'll see how it goes.On a totally related note, welcome home, <a href="http://www.bradjasper.com/archives/2006/03/22/spring-break-back-from-the-trip/">Brad</a>. My Spring Break starts, well, right now. I'll be gone skiing tomorrow and might try to skydive at some point in the coming week. We'll see!
