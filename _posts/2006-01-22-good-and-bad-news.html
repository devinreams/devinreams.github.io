<a href="http://www.ngkhai.net/bizdrivenlife/writings/2006/01/22/there-is-always-a-better-way-to-announce-bad-news/">Wilson Ng shares a funny joke</a>. Read it before you read the rest of this or I'll spoil it... yes, I'll wait... Anyway, the unfunny part about thie joke is I was actually a plane when I heard this announcement. One of our engines failed right after take off, the second while we were out over the Pacific. Since we were flying from New Zealand to Los Angeles and it had only been an hour or so, heading back seemed prudent. Unfortunately for the pilot there was no good way to tell anyone the news. The pilots later let us know that one of the wheels had blown out as well. Later, having put two and two together, it was evident that a tire blew during takeoff and debris flew into the engine. We didn't hear about that wheel part until much later. In any case, landing in the 'brace' position was fun... quietest landing ever.
