Last week brought a number of things to keep me busy. [AKPsi][1] began rush events last week, I started some work on a couple of web clients, have constantly been working on [Community Next][2] planning and, of course, school.

## AKPsi

I&#8217;ve been involved in CU&#8217;s co-ed business fraternity for the last 5 semesters. I pledged, joined as a member, became webmaster and then took over as VP of Operations for a year. For my last semester at school I&#8217;m the VP of Membership meaning I plan and manage the pledge process.

Last week we started rush so I had two information meetings to present at and a Meet and Greet on Friday night. After collecting resumes, some short answer responses and meeting rushees we voted on the new pledge class. It&#8217;s a lot to manage but I&#8217;ve had some excellent help from my pledge masters.

## Web work

Apparently when people think of having a website created, edited, etc. they think of me. In short, that&#8217;s great. I&#8217;ve been approached by two student groups and one student-founded company to work on their websites. I&#8217;m certainly no design guru but I&#8217;m excited to help these groups out.

## Community Next

I&#8217;ll be in California in 11 days which means Noah and I have a little over a week to finish up the conference details. Sponsorship has been secured, reservations have been made, catering has been paid, gifts have been purchased, and so on. This week Noah and I were accused of being unethical which put a damper on things. In short, a cheater turned around and called me the unfair one. It&#8217;s been a wild ride&#8230;

## School

Meh. I think I&#8217;m at work more than I&#8217;m in class. Graduation is only 14 Weekly Updates away. Here&#8217;s to #18!
