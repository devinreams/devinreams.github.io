<a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10811_3-6037090.html">Yahoo's incentives</a> to switch <a href="http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2006/02/09/what-would-it-take-to-get-you-to-switch/">suck</a> (for a few reasons). First, I don't see a single thing that interests me. If Yahoo paid me, I'd gladly switch over and use it (exclusively). I doubt that will happen but hey, I love to complain/rave about anything and everything. Wait, here's an idea: <strong>make your stuff work better than the other guys</strong>. How is it easier to spend money on consumers rather than the product? This old quote is <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000239.html">straight from the Yahoo Blog</a> "<em>This commitment to being the best should be crystal clear from our investments in talented people, <a href="http://research.yahoo.com/">research</a>, <a href="http://next.yahoo.com/">innovation and new products</a></em>". Where do the incentives fit in that list of investments?
