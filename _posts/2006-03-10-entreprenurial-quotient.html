What's your <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/03/whats_your_eq_e.html">Entreprenurial Quotient</a>? I got a 72%. I'm okay with that because a few of the questions ask what are the 'best' and, well, I get to pick what's 'best' right? But seriously, they're some good questions. Oh, and why make us go through the Tickle sign up? If I can make a <a href="http://devinreams.com/firo-b/">FIRO-B assessment</a> you can put together a quiz that doesn't require my birthdate!
