Two things about the site: first, I went ahead and purchased (first time, ever) a webhost. So far I highly recommend <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>. Second, I did the lamest 'Reboot' in the history of <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS Reboot</a>. I took my default K2 theme and changed it into what you see here. Plain white, a little red, and my clever logo. As mentioned, I'm also <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/05/01/adsense-experiment/">trying Adsense</a> but I doubt it will get me far.
