Here&#8217;s one of the best things I&#8217;ve learned while staying in hotels: bring an [Apple AirPort Express][1] wifi base station. I can&#8217;t take credit for tip this *at all*, this is all [Alex][2], but the reason you do this is so you can connect multiple devices through a single access point.

Ideally, you set this access point name and security to be one your devices already know (like the one at your office or house) so you don&#8217;t have to go re-enter passwords all over the place. Plus, most paid hotel services just see the one device (AirPort) and charge you once for that connection, not for your iPhone, iPad, and notebook. Yes, I&#8217;ve once accidentally charged $14.95/day multiplied by three devices to a hotel room. And finally, it helps if you have more than one person traveling.

It&#8217;s a small, lightweight device (hardly bigger than your notebook charger) with easy configuration and a way to save money and hassle while traveling.
