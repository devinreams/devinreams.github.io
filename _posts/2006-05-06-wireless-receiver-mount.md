[<img width="100" height="75" border="0" align="right" alt="Final Mounted" src="http://static.flickr.com/46/141214857_54baaf8643_t.jpg" />][1]I pulled a MacGyver tonight as I was faced with a dilemma. I decided I wanted to use my keyboard tray. Unfortunately my wireless MCE keyboard needs line-of-sight to communicate with the receiver. So, I mounted the receiver on the back of the desk with a binder clip, staple, and a twist tie. [Go check out the photos][2], it&#8217;s genuis really.
