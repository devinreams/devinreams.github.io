The Oreo CEO himself has [tagged me][1] with a meme. I like this one becuase you can tell *a lot* by a person&#8217;s music.

With that said, here are 7 random songs from my collection&#8230;  
<!--more-->

1.  Guster &#8211; Two Points for Honest
2.  E-40 &#8211; Go Hard or Go Home
3.  Missy Elliott &#8211; Partytime
4.  Yung Jock &#8211; It&#8217;s Goin&#8217; Down
5.  Dave Matthews &#8211; Stay or Leave
6.  Chingy &#8211; Brand New Kicks
7.  Head Automatica &#8211; Curious

Diverse, wouldn&#8217;t you say? As an added bonus [I decided to make a music video when I heard Missy Elliott][2] come up. It&#8217;s much harder than I initally thought. Enjoy your Friday.

Oh, and for more insight, here&#8217;s [my last.fm page][3] (recently reset).

Tag: [Paul Stamatiou][4] and [Chris Morrell][5].
