[Scoble is upset][1] because people are talking more about Google than Microsoft. [Nathan][2] is also expressing his concern.

Guys, the reasoning behind all of this is pretty clear. Yes, MSN has a much larger user base than GMail. But, all the popular nerds with blogs, all those guys &#8216;buzzing&#8217; about Google Domains: they love Google. The people who know what an MX record is don&#8217;t really want their domain on MSN Live Messenger nor MSN Live Mail. They want to use the weapon-of-choice for nerds everywhere: GMail. I&#8217;ve used both, I express the same sentiment. I&#8217;m a Live beta tester, I use the new MSN, I use the new email&#8230; I like GMail better.

Oh, and why would people have ever said &#8216;MSN goes after Outlook&#8217;? I&#8217;ve used a product called the &#8220;[MSN Outlook Connector][3]&#8220;. Hey, when/if Google comes out with a calendar are we going to get upset because we didn&#8217;t mention MSN has one, too?

Put simply, MSN jumped into the email game far too late. I think we all can agree on that. GMail changed the way many people do email and it will always attract the related &#8216;buzz&#8217;.

Okay, guys, for once somebody copied Microsoft. ;-)
