It&#8217;s nearly Thanksgiving and I&#8217;ve realized that perhaps I&#8217;m thankful for a bit more than my [chair, monitors and slippers][1]. Perhaps life is a tad more than the physical objects we own. In fact, take away any and all possessions you have: what&#8217;s left?

## My attitude

I&#8217;m thankful for the attitude I&#8217;ve somehow acquired over the years. I constantly strive for optimism and rarely complain about my situation. Perhaps its ignorance or just plain stupidity but I can&#8217;t get too upset with the hand I&#8217;m dealt. I&#8217;m thankful for that because I sometimes see people around me and, well, the stress is taking years from their lives.

## My intellect

I&#8217;ve said it before, I&#8217;m not necessarily a smart guy. I&#8217;d argue I&#8217;m clever. I was somehow given an ability to look at certain things and simply understand them. I&#8217;m thankful for that and I realize I&#8217;d have to live my life quite differently if it weren&#8217;t for that. I don&#8217;t mean to sound conceited, I&#8217;m honestly lucky some things come a bit easier.

## The Internet

I figure I&#8217;ll go beyond the typical &#8216;family, friends, and good health&#8217;, by also saying I&#8217;m thankful for the internet. Seriously. It&#8217;s provided me with a number of experiences, stories, and learning opportunities. In addition, I&#8217;ve met a number of great people online. People across the country, on the other side of the world, and even within a half-day&#8217;s drive of me. These people all come from different backgrounds and have so much to share. I find the internet to be invaluable. I think it&#8217;s here to stay&#8230;

## A tasty meal

In all honesty, I don&#8217;t know why we celebrate Thanksgiving. I think it&#8217;s a great excuse for eating and watching football, two of my more favorite things to do. I also figure it&#8217;s a slick excuse to get lots of people to the stores. In any case, I&#8217;m thankful I&#8217;ll have a nice big meal to go home to and a bit of time to relax.

**Happy Thanksgiving. Enjoy the time off and if you&#8217;re going shopping on Friday, well, be careful out there.**
