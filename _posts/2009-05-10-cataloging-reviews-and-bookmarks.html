In a prior effort to minimize my online activity I removed myself from using a lot of websites. Two of which I've come back to: <a href="http://yelp.com/">Yelp</a> and <a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>.

I find a lot of interesting sites and articles online and I've continually found myself thinking "shoot, what was that site name?" or "where did I read that article about ____?" I've come back to <a href="http://delicious.com/devinreams">Delicious</a> to help catalog these sites.

I'm also interested in sharing my thoughts on restaurants and bars I've visited. Yelp has been an invaluable source for finding good places to eat. I love being snarky and sharing my opinion, so, I'm also back on <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9uoDujDA8KD3kXKfwvJiqg">Yelp</a> posting reviews.

An interesting side-note: I've stopped actively using <a href="http://brightkite.com/">Brightkite</a>. In the numerous interactions, I've found little-to-no value in cataloging and constantly keeping track of my location. It is fun to engage in conversations at conferences and get togethers.. but certainly nothing that <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> can't achieve.
