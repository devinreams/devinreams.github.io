I worked at Six Flags this summer (Cash Control Supervisor) and I&#8217;ve come to love and hate the Venga Boys&#8217; song (We Like to Party). The individual who danced to that song on the commercials has been identified as one of the *Queer Eye for the Straight Guy* guys, Danny Teeson. As usual I&#8217;ll remain skeptical (as I&#8217;ve seen thousands of rumors online). Paul Davidson has &#8216;the scoop&#8217; at [Writing For My Enjoyment][1].
