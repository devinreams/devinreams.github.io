This week I begin my year&#8217;s worth of updates on me, myself and I. It only makes sense given the site is called Devin Reams dot com, right? This should be a pretty interesting goal slash resolution to keep. Tune in to see how I stretch my life to seem exciting and eventful.

## Skiing

I&#8217;ve been up skiing nine times so far this season. I have a [Rocky Mountain Super Pass][1] which gets me unlimited skiing at Copper Mountain and Winter Park. Both are owned by Intrawest (the folks who bring you Whistler/Blackcomb, Mammoth, etc.). I enjoy both resorts &#8212; I&#8217;ve been going to Copper for years and years. This year I got the pass for half off so I couldn&#8217;t pass it up. Any other year I&#8217;d get the Five Mountain Pass (which gives me 10 days at Vail).

This week I got my skis edged and waxed on Tuesday. Went skiing Wednesday. Fell on my skis Wednesday afternoon, [sliced my face][2], skied a bit more and went home. I proceeded to head back up on Thursday. I like to think I&#8217;m hardcore. PS: Check out the [Colorado Snow Blog][3].

## Fondue

Wednesday was the first night I had ever had fondue. To say it was delicious would be an understatement. Plus, the company I enjoyed wasn&#8217;t too bad, either. It was nice to have a full four-course meal. As someone who doesn&#8217;t enjoy cooking the meal was worth every penny. If you have a chance to check out the [Melting Pot][4] I&#8217;d recommend it. Heck, just go for the chocolate dessert.

## Community Next

I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of planning and work on the [upcoming conference][5]. Everything like marketing, website work, finalizing the VIP dinner, booking speaker hotels, etc. It&#8217;s been a good experience working, planning, laughing and arguing with Noah.

## Snow

It snowed again this week. Not a ton (like the last two) but enough to shut down schools, businesses, roads, cause a big avalanche, etc. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m sick of this yet&#8230;
