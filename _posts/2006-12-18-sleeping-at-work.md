While I&#8217;m nearly through with finals I&#8217;ve not quite crossed the finish line yet. This means there&#8217;s been a lot of studying lately. For many that means a lot less sleep. Well, if you&#8217;re like me and still working 15 hours a week you&#8217;ll probably wonder how you can get away with sleeping at work.

I couldn&#8217;t help but pass this along (thanks, Aunt Shiela). We&#8217;ll see how well it works tomorrow. With that said, here it it:

## Top Five Things To Say After Caught Sleeping At Your Desk

1.  They told me at the Blood Bank this might happen.
2.  This is just a 15 minute power nap they raved about in the time management course you sent me to.
3.  Whew! Guess I left the top off the Whiteout. You probably got here just in time.
4.  Did you ever notice sound coming out of these keyboards when you put your ear down real close?
5.  Raise your head slowly and say, &#8220;&#8230;in Jesus&#8217; name, Amen.&#8221;

Keep on keeping on, everyone&#8230; I&#8217;m off to study.
