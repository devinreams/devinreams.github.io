I&#8217;m in a good mood and my brilliant mentor, [noah][1], suggested I create a caption contest for the following picture:

<center>
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/2347003136/" title="Reading the paper by devinreams, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2085/2347003136_76556a6007_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Reading the paper" /></a>
</center>

<strike>Winner receives a $10 Amazon.com gift certificate. **Leave your caption in the comments.**</strike>

**Winner:** With my invisible knife, I stab at thee, foul editor.

*PS: Photo taken with my new iPhone (on T-Mobile, ask me how!).*
