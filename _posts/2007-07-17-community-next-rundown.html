I had a blast last weekend in San Francisco. My buddy Noah (and Adam) hosted the second Community Next conference. Luckily I was invited. I've put some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/sets/72157600854136592/">photos online</a> and my quick thoughts are found below.

	<h2>VIP Dinner</h2>
	Friday was the VIP Dinner. I chatted with a bunch of awesome guys including the CTO of <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> Tom Conrad, <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/">Shel Israel</a>, Eric from <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">icanhascheezburger</a>, the <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/">MyBlogLog</a> team, the <a href="http://www.scrapblog.com/">Scrapblog</a> team, <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/">Dave McClure</a>, <a href="http://andrewchen.typepad.com/">Andrew Chen</a>, and so on.

	<h2>Pre-Party</h2>
	Then we hit the pre-party at Old Pro (in Palo Alto). It was a ton of fun (and sponsored by <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> again). I hung out with great folks including the aforementioned plus <a href="www.femgineer.com">Poornima</a> from <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint</a>, Shivani from <a href="http://women2.org/">Women2.0</a>, Gabe from <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a>, and so on and so forth. I was humbled all evening. I also had the pleasure of hanging out with Andre Nosalsky, <a href="http://www.thefuego.com">Scott Hurff</a> and <a href="http://www.eventvue.com/">Rob Johnson</a>. They happened to be my roommates for the evening. Thats a story in and of itself.

	<h2>The Conference</h2>

	The next morning the conference was at the <a href="http://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/">PlugandPlayTechCenter</a> which was an excellent spot for the conference. It went by a lot faster than the last one. Perhaps that's because I could actually sit and enjoy it. Which I did. I heard some cool people speak about an awesome area right now: viral marketing. We heard from employee number four at MySpace, icanhascheezburger, hi5, Pownce, Justin.tv, Crazy Egg, Timothy Ferriss, and so on. A lot of Facebook discussion and plenty on what you should and should not do to attract and retain users.

	<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
	Another great conference. I enjoyed chatting with everyone there and am still excited by the caliber of the attendees. Like I said, I was lucky to be there. The Community Next conferences have been phenomenal and I  look forward to the future (yes, there will be more!).
