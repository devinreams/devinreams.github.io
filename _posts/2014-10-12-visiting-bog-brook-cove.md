Having been in Maine for a couple weekends, we were really enjoying the amazing fall weather. It was still warm and the trees were beautiful.

We headed up towards Lubec to see an old family friend and stay with her at her family cabin on the coast. The amazing weather continued and we had a great time sitting out and watching the water, poking around Lubec and Campobello island, hiking, and visiting lighthouses.

We had an amazing weekend and continued the streak of great experiences during our adventure in Maine. Be sure to check out [my photos from visiting Bog Brook Cove](http://photos.devin.reams.me/visiting-bog-brook-cove) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co/).
