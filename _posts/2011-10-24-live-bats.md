This is a treat: every fall Rob Mies, the director of the [Organization for Bat Conservation][1], visits the [Denver Museum of Nature and Science][2] and brings some bats with him. They&#8217;re misunderstood (they&#8217;re a cornerstone in many ecosystems as they eat insects, pollenate, and spread seeds) and actually kinda cute. This gal, a flying fox bat, is almost 3 feet tall.

Happy Halloween(ish)!
