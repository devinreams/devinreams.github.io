The weekend after our summer road trip we headed up towards Silverthorne with a big group of friends to do some camping and get a nice day of hiking in.

We ended up at the Green Mountain Reservoir and hiked up to Surprise Lake. It was a great trip and a fun reminder of how lucky we are to live in Colorado.
