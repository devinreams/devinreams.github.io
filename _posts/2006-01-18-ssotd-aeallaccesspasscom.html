I bring to you another Shoddy Site of the Day. This one comes from the clothing retailer, American Eagle. I've always had a problem with AE's style because the girl's clothing looks so nice and sophisticated whereas the guys dress as if they can't really see the mixture of colors they just put on.

Now I feel the same about their 'All Access Pass'es website. I don't know if their designers really saw what they put together. Heck, I don't even know if they tried it out themselves.

I guess what everyone is trying to do with websites these days is stand out. Yes, a weird unusable website is what makes you unique... just like everyone else.

In any case, this user-interface is laughable. I don't even want to share it but you can see just from opening up <a href="http://www.aeallaccesspass.com/">aeallaccesspass.com</a> and clicking one of the buttons. Warning: yes you indeed <em>are</em> at risk of having a seisure from all the movement. Don't say I didn't warn you. It gets worse if you actually login. Honestly, I don't pay $60/month to watch the website load itself. I thought the point of high-speed was no waiting.

Again, this looks like a classic designer's case of 'I <em>can</em> do it so I <em>should</em>'. Hovering navigation windows and popup windows are so 'cluttery' that I absolutely detest having to take on so many active objects at once.

Plus, in Firefox the page loads, you can see it but there's something in the background that takes another (literally) 5 minutes to load the page. During this time you're held hostage and you can't click on anything else.Oh, and when you click any of the navigation the image breaks and shifts down and does all sorts of troubling things. Essentially the one way to get around the website breaks when you want to use it.
This website sucks as much as the men's shirts. This site alone is too much trouble. I don't care how much I can save on jeans next time I stop in, I'm done with the 'All Access Pass'.

Keep it simple, stupids!
