This article may be misleading, when I talk about two-oh I don&#8217;t mean (Web) 2.0, I mean twenty, my age as of today. It&#8217;s a nice round number but that&#8217;s about all this birthday has going for it. Honestly, I can see why people stop looking forward to their birthdays as life goes on.

## Twenty is a tease

<!--more-->

I don&#8217;t mean to sound so cynical, I&#8217;m just making a point: 20 is useless. I thought 19 was bad but 20 is a total tease. It doesn&#8217;t help when everyone I associate with is at least 21 if not 22 or older. Even the other day I was quickly reminded how terrible this is. When asking about tips for a first date it was recommended I take someone to get a drink.

Sure, maybe a rum and coke. She&#8217;ll get the rum, I&#8217;ll drink the coke.

## Reflections

But, thats not to say the last year (and the year to come) are all that bad. Since my last birthday I&#8217;ve certainly changed. I&#8217;ve been the Vice President of [AKPsi][1] which has taught me a lot. I co-founded [yopos][2] which has introduced me to so many people I can&#8217;t even begin to list them. I&#8217;ve started my own webcomic, I&#8217;ve been on the Dean&#8217;s List again, I&#8217;ve joined Beta Gamma Sigma (honor society). I&#8217;ve held a number of jobs and learned a lot. I&#8217;ve even changed my major from Information Systems to Accounting.

But it hasn&#8217;t all been good. I no longer talk to a close (ex girl-) friend. That&#8217;s certainly been a learning experience in itself. Not just about relationships or people but myself as well.

But enough boring stuff. Thanks to everyone who left their best wishes. I&#8217;m thinking of doing a (semi) daily video log. Not to entertain necessairly but just so I have an archieve of me and life. We&#8217;ll see how that goes&#8230;

365 and counting&#8230;
