I&#8217;ve been asked to review ([sponsored][1]) an awesome resource put together by Daniel Kovach of [Scholarships Around the U.S][2]. First off, his site is an amazing place for students to find information on financial aid. He has a lot of opportunities ([Paul][3] won money as a student blogger) and a lot of good information including his guide: [118 Ways to Save Money in College][4].

At first glance I laughed when I saw his section on alcohol savings ideas. But then I realized it was probably very relevant to many students. Some figures I&#8217;ve found indicate the average student spends over $1,100 each year on alcohol. That&#8217;s huge! If you&#8217;re going to drink at least be smart about the way you spend money on your vices- this guide has some decent ideas.

Some tips are self-evident (ask friends for textbooks, don&#8217;t buy coffee daily, etc.) but for many there are tips we could all relate to. With 118 pointers anyone can take away something from this guide. Personally, I&#8217;m going to try eating more oatmeal, apparently it&#8217;s cheap and filling&#8230;

A lot of my money is spent on entertainment (eating out, movies, etc.) and I&#8217;d echo a lot of what is said in these areas. I&#8217;ve personally shut off the cable television and, as the guide mentions, I watch a lot of shows online. In fact, I just watched the last 5 episodes of Lost on ABC&#8217;s own website (less commercials, less time wasted!).

Honestly I love this guide. I&#8217;m glad I found it. Sure, it&#8217;s a bit overwhelming to sit down and read it all. If you have the time, though, you&#8217;ll probably find some great ideas you&#8217;d never thought of. For example, with Christmas coming up: ask for a subscription to Blockbuster Online or something practical (that will save you money). Or maybe a Dance Dance Revolution game to help get some inexpensive exercise.

**Please check out this guide&#8211; a lot of the concepts and ideas don&#8217;t apply to just college students, anyone will find it very practical.**
