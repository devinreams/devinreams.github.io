After we [crossed the border into Maine](http://photos.devin.reams.me/driving-to-maine) we aimed towards Weld and Mount Blue State Park. The plan was to meet a group of friends at the park for a weekend of relaxing and camping.

We drove through the park and saw wild turkeys along with an amazing sunset from high on the hill.

The next morning we woke up to our private beach and acres of forest all to ourselves.

It was a beautiful location and a great way to kick-off our little adventure in Maine. Be sure to check out [my photos from camping at Mount Blue State Park](http://photos.devin.reams.me/camping-at-mount-blue) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co/).
