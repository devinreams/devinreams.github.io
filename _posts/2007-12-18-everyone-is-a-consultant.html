Penelope Trunk is predicting it: <a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2007/12/12/the-end-of-work-as-we-know-it/">the end of consulting</a>. I agree. I call myself a 'consultant' but I realized that all the work I've done in the last few years has been, in essence, "consulting."

I'm not surprised, either. It's easier than ever to become an expert (<a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, right?) and it's especially easy to work from home (<a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/">Web Worker Daily</a> rocks!). In fact, I intend to work from home or a number of remote client locations for the next few weeks. Heck, I work for a Big Four and I use Toggl to track my time across clients, projects and many other things.

That's what I love about where I work. There's a desire to be entrepreneurial, a leader in innovation. Our partner realizes we need to adapt and I strongly believe we're all consulting for a variety of people (clients, colleagues, etc.). And once everyone is consulting, no one is consulting.
