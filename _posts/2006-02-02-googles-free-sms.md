It looks like [Google has done][1] what [teleflip][2] set out to do: free text messages sent online. Unfortunately you *do* need to know your recepient&#8217;s provider. There&#8217;s another catch: &#8220;we might also log the text of the message you send, in order to investigate and correct technical problems with the service&#8221;. Uh oh.. has anyone called this [evil][3] yet?
