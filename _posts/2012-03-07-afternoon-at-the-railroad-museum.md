The Colorado Railroad Museum is right outside of Golden (on the way up CO-58 on a frontage road) and it&#8217;s a few acres of nothing but big, old rail cars and engines. You can walk around, poke your head in some, touch the controls on others. Most are narrow gauge (Colorado couldn&#8217;t do standard on account of the mountains, tunnels, etc.) so it&#8217;s a unique treat you won&#8217;t really find elsewhere.
