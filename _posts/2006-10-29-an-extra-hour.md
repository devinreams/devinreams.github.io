As you should have realized by now, today we (well, most of us) celebrated the wonderful thing called [Daylight Saving Time][1]. In short, we gained an extra hour today. I woke up at 11am which was really 10am. I used my extra hour to sleep today.

But what about you? What are your plans for this extra hour? Spend it wisely, we only get this opportunity once a year. Today I took that extra hour and slept in. I&#8217;ve been extremely busy this week and didn&#8217;t get as many naps as I would&#8217;ve like ([biphasic sleep][2]*). I probably should have spent my hour working on something productive. I have a big accounting test this week. Oh well.

What if we had an extra hour every day? How would you spend your time? I&#8217;d probably use that hour to read a book. No matter how I try I have a hard time fitting time in to just sit down and read. It&#8217;s given me an idea for a company, more on that later.

Now what if we had an hour less each day? What would suffer? Would you sleep less? Maybe go to the gym less? I have no idea what I&#8217;d do. I already feel like my days are overbooked. I&#8217;m sure the same would hold true if we had 30 hours in a day. Like some fish, I feel we adapt to the size of our environment. If we had less time, we&#8217;d do less. This is why, although our lives are &#8220;more efficient&#8221; we seem busier than ever. We keep pushing and striving for more (craziness) in our lives.

Happy Daylight Savings.

* Someone made a biphasic sleep entry on Wikipedia based on my FAQ. For more information on how biphasic sleep affects my life feel free to search my archives.
