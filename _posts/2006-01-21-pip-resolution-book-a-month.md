Last year I resolved to read a book a month. I fell a few books short of my goal, unfortunately. In hindsight, I&#8217;m not sure why. I think the problem was with how I scheduled/used my time and that&#8217;s obviously beginning to change this year.

With that said I&#8217;m going to go for a book each month again. First on the list is finishing The World Is Flat. I&#8217;m about a quarter through it (of 500 pages). As far as the following months are concerned, I&#8217;ve got a few books lying around here and then I&#8217;ll head over to [my own Amazon wishlist][1]. Naturally, I&#8217;ll be posting my thoughts and reviews of each book.

Heck, with all my new free time I was able to catch up on 12 magazines. If I fail this I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do with myself&#8230;
