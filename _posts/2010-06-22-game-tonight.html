One of [Crowd Favorite's](http://crowdfavorite.com/) recent [workshop](http://crowdfavorite.com/workshop/) projects has been to answer the question: [is there a (professional sports) game tonight that would affect my commute](http://gametonight.in/)? Now there's a simple web app to answer that. Even living downtown, I think to myself "why are there so many people in my bar tonight?" and quickly I realize there's a baseball game down the street. Additionally, Apple recently selected it as a [Web App Staff Pick](http://crowdfavorite.com/news/2010/06/game-tonight-selected-as-apple-web-app-staff-pick/).
