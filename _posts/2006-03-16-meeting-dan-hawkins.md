Many of you associate CU Boulder with any number of things. Sex, drugs, football and rock and roll are just a few of the things we&#8217;ve become well known for (not the [nationally recognized physics professor][1], the [volunteerism][2] nor the [Nobel Laureate][3]). In any case, football has been a cornerstone in the school&#8217;s culture. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m excited to see Dan Hawkins coaching. He understands the culture and wants to help re-establish CU as a classy school.

Hawkins came in and spoke to a large group of us the other night and I enjoyed hearing what he had to say. He&#8217;s full of wisdom that will (hopefully) rub off onto the players and the school. He was actually very candid and openly talked a lot about himself and where he&#8217;s coming from. Hawkins has come a long way. He pointed out the fact that his salary was less than $20,000 at one point. He&#8217;d even been on welfare. But, he said, he&#8217;s one of those people who &#8220;takes care of the details.&#8221; Life is full of the little things, the details, and he&#8217;s gone through life focusing on those.. not the money. Now he&#8217;s coaching and making $900,00 (with potential to earn double that).

He put up a nice acronym (for life and success) on the board. It was &#8216;GAMES&#8217;. I vividly remember him talking about &#8216;G&#8217; becuase it stood for &#8216;Goals&#8217;&#8230; something I&#8217;ve started thinking about more and more, lately.  
Anyway, I&#8217;ve been embarassed for my school. I entered CU as the sex scandals emerged. I was there for the [student section ejection][4]. The students don&#8217;t care, though. Nobody does anything about this.
