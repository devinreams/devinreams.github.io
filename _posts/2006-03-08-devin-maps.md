[Ben][1] put up some maps of where he&#8217;s travelled. I&#8217;m actually surprised he hasn&#8217;t been more places (yet). In any case, he beat me to blogging about travel&#8230;

A month or so ago I created profiles on [43 things][2], [43 people][3], and [43 places][4] (all found on my[ About][5] page). I played around with the profiles and found the websites to very interesting. But, hands down, 43 places interested me the most.

*Aside: Interviewing potential rushees for [AKPsi][6] was interesting becuase nearly every student said they&#8217;d &#8220;travel&#8221; if they had unlimited free time. It seems that traveling may be one of the greater human desires (right below socializing).*

Many people are very visual. I wouldn&#8217;t necessairly classify myself as a &#8216;visual&#8217; person but when I take a look at a map of the world denoting where I&#8217;ve been&#8230; well, that&#8217;s pretty neat looking. Have you ever been to a touristy location and seen one of those push-pin maps? It&#8217;s fun to look at because everyone who has visited puts a pin on the map to show where they came from.

This is the exact opposite. This is the home version. I&#8217;ve seen a few people who have a push-pin map for where they&#8217;ve travelled&#8230; but they&#8217;ve travelled *a lot*. 43 places is fun because it&#8217;s easy, informative, and I can see *everyone&#8217;s* map. In addition, I can list where I want to go and solicit advice from other users. If you&#8217;re just looking for some reference material you can browse the site and learn about places people have already been and see the pictures they&#8217;ve taken.

I dreamed (literally, it was in a dream) about creating a travel-related site like this a long time ago. I&#8217;m glad someone beat me to it. Post a link to your profile in the comments once you&#8217;ve created it&#8230; I&#8217;m interested to see where my readers (family, friends) have been.
