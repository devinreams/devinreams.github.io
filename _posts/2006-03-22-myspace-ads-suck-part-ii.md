If you haven&#8217;t noticed, I [don&#8217;t][1] [like][2] MySpace very much (read [MySpace Ads Suck][3]). Just like I don&#8217;t like AIM (devinhatesaim is really my screenname). To me, AIM is to MySpace as Google Talk is to Facebook. Anyway, MySpace&#8217;s big ugly website and ads still suck.

Apparently those terrible wastes of space &#8211;yes, the ads that mix and blend in with the content&#8211; are apparently one of the main reasons companies are leery of advertising on MySpace. Don&#8217;t believe me? Read [this page][4] and this quote:

> &#8220;We&#8217;re being cautious because there&#8217;s a blurring between advertising and content, and the content does rub off on your brand.&#8221;
> 
> -Dawn Hudson, president and CEO of Pepsi-Cola North America

It&#8217;s hard always being right&#8230;
