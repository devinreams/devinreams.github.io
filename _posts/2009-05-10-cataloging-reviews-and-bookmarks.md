In a prior effort to minimize my online activity I removed myself from using a lot of websites. Two of which I&#8217;ve come back to: [Yelp][1] and [Delicious][2].

I find a lot of interesting sites and articles online and I&#8217;ve continually found myself thinking &#8220;shoot, what was that site name?&#8221; or &#8220;where did I read that article about \____?&#8221; I&#8217;ve come back to [Delicious][3] to help catalog these sites.

I&#8217;m also interested in sharing my thoughts on restaurants and bars I&#8217;ve visited. Yelp has been an invaluable source for finding good places to eat. I love being snarky and sharing my opinion, so, I&#8217;m also back on [Yelp][4] posting reviews.

An interesting side-note: I&#8217;ve stopped actively using [Brightkite][5]. In the numerous interactions, I&#8217;ve found little-to-no value in cataloging and constantly keeping track of my location. It is fun to engage in conversations at conferences and get togethers.. but certainly nothing that [Twitter][6] can&#8217;t achieve.
