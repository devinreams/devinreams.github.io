<a href="www.rohailrizvi.com">Rohail Rizvi</a> introduced me to a website he has been working on while in college: <a href="http://www.walamu.com/">Walamu</a>. Walamu is posed to become a successful college marketplace with classifieds and textbook sales (local to universities). Rohail is a student at Rutgers and a member of a very neat young entrepreneur group called <a href="http://www.mindpetals.com/">Mind Petals</a>. I liked his story enough to look into Walamu a bit more...

	<!--more-->

	First off, Walamu does not come across as YACTS (Yet Another Cheap Textbook Site). Walamu is structured more like a Craigslist for colleges. Although Rutgers is the only college on the site right now it seems to have become popular with the students. Oh, and go take a look at the site's <a href="http://www.walamu.com/blog/">blog</a>. As of this writing, they're offering a free night with a stripper to a lucky classifieds poster. Who else does that? Who else <em>has</em> done that? Wow.

	Additionally, you look at the site and it looks professional, it looks clean, it seems functional. Most textbook and classified sites I've seen (including Craigslist) are <em>too</em> simple and <em>too</em> empty. Sure, you need a community and you need an easy-enough site to get to the point: exchanging of goods and services.

	But, you look at this site and it looks great, it looks like a lot of time and resources have been put into it. Well, yes. But would you believe that one guy (named Rohail) is behind it <strong>all</strong>? The same Rohail who is still <a href="http://walamu.com/blog/?p=9">going through college, eating Ramen, and having a hard time finding money to purchase textbooks</a>.

	I like what Rohail has done with Walamu; it's the perfect entrepreneur story. <strong>He's found a problem that he deeply understands and he has created a solution.</strong> I think a lot of people, including students, can look at this story and realize that, yes, I can create something. I can go out and <em>do</em> things no matter the limitations.

	Personally, I wouldn't create a <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/8-stupid-frat-boy-business-ideas">YACTS-competitor</a> though. ;)
