At work I found some fun city names. I figured I should keep a list of some of the better ones:

*   Embarass, MN
*   Friesland, MN
*   Wild Rice, ND
*   Gaylord, MN
*   Vader, WA
*   Cheney, WA
*   Cash, AR
*   Joetown, WV
*   Indiahoma, OK
*   Sherwood Forest, MD
*   Scholls, OR
*   Suncook, NH

I&#8217;ll have plenty more on Thursday!
