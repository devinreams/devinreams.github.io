A group of GitHubbers :octocat:, self included, are headed to Japan :jp: for [GitHub Kaigi](http://lanyrd.com/2014/githubkaigi/), a conference organized by the GitHub User Group. This will be my first conference as a GitHubber and I'm excited for the opportunity to meet so many GitHub users and enthusiasts next weekend.

I fly :airplane: out tomorrow morning and arrive in Tokyo on Sunday. @dsorkin, @dice and I will spend next week — before the conference — meeting with [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/) customers, gathering feedback, and saying "thanks" as much as we can.

I've never visited Japan :japan: before and I'm excited to see Tokyo. I'll be sure to bring back lot of photos. :wink:
