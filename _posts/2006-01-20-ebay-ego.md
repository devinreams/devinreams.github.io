Is it just me or is eBay the best place to go to boost your ego? Seriously, it&#8217;s been a while since I checked my feedback but I can&#8217;t help but get a warm feeling reading compliments like &#8220;Excellent Guy&#8221; and &#8220;honest, reasonable, the best!!!!&#8221;. It&#8217;s like these people *really* know me.
