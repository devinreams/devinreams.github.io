I wanted to reflect on a few of those fun things, places, people and memories that entered my life this year this year. With no hesitation I present my year in cities and celebrities:

**Cities**

*   Boulder, CO (moved from here)
*   Denver, CO (to here)
*   San Francisco, CA ([CommunityNext][1], birthday)
*   Bay Area, CA (San Jose, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, [Jelly Belly Factory][2])
*   Beijing, [China][3] (Spring Break, Great Wall, Forbidden City)
*   Shanghai, [China][3] (Incubator visit, Ex-pat panels, [Pearl Tower)][4]
*   Suzhou, [China][5] (tea garden)
*   Los Angeles, CA (training, [bull riding][6], Manhattan/Venice/Huntington Beaches, Dodgers)
*   Cleveland, OH (more training, more bull riding, tequila, [Indians][7])
*   Santa Fe, NM (visiting an old friend, culture)

**Celebrities** (they&#8217;re internet-famous)

*   [Noah Kagan][8] (the reason I got to meet so many people, awesome guy)
*   Ramit Sethi ([finance fella][9], [dysentery shirt][10])
*   [Penelope Trunk][11] (not quite as crazy as her writing suggests)
*   [Ben Casnocha][12] (good sushi, wiz kid)
*   Andrew Hyde ([startupweekend][13], political webmaster)
*   [Josh Spear][14] (definition of cool)
*   [Shel Israel][15] (almost like a grandpa, great stories)
*   [Tom Conrad][16] ([pandora][17] CIO, why I bought [sonos][18])
*   [Brian Breslin][19] (world-class web guy, [webpl.us][20], [infinimedia][21])
*   [Jonathan Otto][22] ([ottobib][23])
*   [David Mandell (me.dium founder)][24]
*   [Dean Steadman][25] (me.dium community guy, gave me the shirt my girlfriend says is her fave on me) 
*   [socialthing! team][26] (Matt, Brian, Ben, Joel, cool guys)
*   [EventVue team][27] (Rob and Josh, fun times in CA with guys from CO)
*   [Dave McClure][28] (500 hats, smart guy with lots to say)
*   [Dave Feinleib][29] (sharp VC, very flattering, I&#8217;ll get into PE some day because of him)
*   [Andrew Chen][30] (prodigy, advertising/web guru)
*   [Kareen Mayan][31] (education entrepreneur)
*   [Daniel Newman][32] (webpreneur, so much going on)

&#8230;and so many more people. Some I didn&#8217;t even get to meet in person but had the opportunity to work with, talk to or cross paths ([Ryan Healy and Ryan Paugh][33], [Jeremy Wright][34], everyone at [9rules][35] especially Scrivs, Tyme, Mike, [seanrox][36], everyone from Startup Weekend (Micah, Michael, Charlie, John).

Anyway, a good year for new friendships and heres to many more!
