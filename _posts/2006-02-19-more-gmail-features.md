I&#8217;m moving exclusively to Google Talk. Feel free to add devin.reams at gmail dot com. If I were to do the same analysis I did on [MySpace ads][1] on an AIM chat window you&#8217;d be as frustrated as I am with wasted space. Anyway, [Garett has done more source-code investigating][2]. Interesting indeed. I&#8217;m even more interested by the fact that nobody really told me about Yahoo&#8217;s voicemail capabilities.
