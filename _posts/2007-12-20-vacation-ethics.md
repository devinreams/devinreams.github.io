The dilemma is simple: I get next Tuesday off for Christmas (thanks, Christians) but I don&#8217;t get Christmas Eve off. I have a Monday gap. The same goes for New Years and New Years Eve. These floating days off in the middle of the week sound like &#8220;well you&#8217;d take those weeks off anyway.&#8221;

Wrong.

What if I don&#8217;t want to take the time off? What if I want to get lots done while everyone else is at home? What if I don&#8217;t celebrate Christ-related or late-night-binge-drinking holidays? I&#8217;m forced to shut down along with the rest of the country?

Okay, fine.

But I have no work to do on Monday. I have no clients to work with on Monday. Why don&#8217;t we just get Monday off, too? Hmm, I&#8217;m faced with the following:

*   **Go to the office** and sit there, alone, refreshing my email and trying to find something to do that will help develop my career.
*   **Take the vacation day** because I&#8217;m essentially forced to since everyone else is.
*   **Work from home** even though it&#8217;s not permitted and even though there will be nothing to do. Oh, and nobody would be around to notice.

What would you do in this situation?
