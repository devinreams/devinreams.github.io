BoingBoing points to a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/09/facebook_prank_on_po.html">clever little trick played on Facebook</a>. I knew an RA who busted a floor full of kids because they posted all their ?shenanigans? on a Facebook group. Their bragging allowed the RA to use the Facebook group as evidence and they were all punished. Oh the world we live in!
