**Senate says English is national, unifying tongue**  
The Senate agreed on Thursday to make English the national language of the United States and moments later also adopted a milder alternative calling English the country&#8217;s &#8220;unifying language.&#8221; ([Source][1])

Wow, now people can&#8217;t keep touting that stupid &#8220;there is no national langue&#8221; argument. Well&#8230; if it makes it all the way through the House.
