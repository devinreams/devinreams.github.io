This past week Rachel and I took off on a little vacation. We drove our new Prius (averaged 47 MPG!) through Wyoming, South Dakota, into Iowa, and back through Nebraska to Colorado.

Along the way we saw sights (Mount Rushmore!) and camped out (at the Little House on the Prairie homestead!) and had a great time.

Check out the [photos and stories from our summer road trip](https://photos.devin.reams.me/2014-summer-road-trip) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co).
