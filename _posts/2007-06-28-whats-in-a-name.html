<a href="http://okdork.com/author/andre/">Andre</a> wrote <a href="http://okdork.com/2007/06/27/how-to-name-your-product/">an interesting article on naming products</a> yesterday. This is where I  step in and argue the opposite: <em>names don't matter</em>.

	<p>I was talking with <a href="http://www.chriskjennings.com/">Chris</a> one morning and we stumbled into an interesting discussion. <strong>What do you think of when you hear of some famous company names for the first time?</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Burger King and McDonalds</strong> - If you heard these two for the first time which would make you think 'delicious' and which would make you think tools or something?</li>
		<li><strong>Maceys and Forbes</strong> - Would you know the difference between a clothing store and a business magazine? Using a last name tells me nothing about a company. <strong>Wal-Mart</strong> and <strong>Sam's Club</strong> are awesome extensions of Sam Walton's name.</li>
		<li><strong>General Motors, Ford, Toyota</strong> - Hmm, I'd think General Motors is probably something to do with motors. Cars though? Perhaps. Ford and Toyota? No way.</li>
		<li><strong>Safeway</strong> - First aid? Airbag manufacturer?</li>
		<li><strong>Flickr</strong> - Something to do with light. A camera flash.</li>
		<li><strong>meebo</strong> - Something about myself but I'd never think instant messaging.</li>
		<li><strong>Pandora</strong> - Something bad, cluttered, uncontrollable. Wow, isn't it all about the opposite?</li>
		<li><strong>Google -</strong> I know everyone in elementary school was fascinated by the word 'googolplex' I'm sure I'd think of "a lot" and maybe math. Search, though? Never.</li>
		<li><strong>OK Dork</strong>- Uh....</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It's amazing how many companies actually use family names. Check out the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2007/full_list/index.html">Fortune 100</a> list: Wells Fargo, Sears, McKesson, Morgan Stanley,  Time Warner, Walgreens, Lockheed Martin, Lowes, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Merrill Lynch, Walt Disney, etc.</p>
	<p>So, when you're spending hours coming up with a name for your new company, product, service or feature maybe it's not worth your time. If it's good the name will follow...</p>

	Feel free to prove me wrong...
