I&#8217;m torn. Is it fair for Comcast to compensate me a dollar-and-change for a **full** day&#8217;s worth of downed cable access? I spend a lot of time on the internet! It&#8217;s my life! I feel that my inability to get online and watch TV was worth waaaaay more than a dollar. But wait, I truly feel that my cable bill is outrageous. So, huh, does the cable market make any sense? Oh well, with no internet I had to actually sit down and write my 10-page paper on entrepreneurship. I&#8217;ll be sharing it soon..
