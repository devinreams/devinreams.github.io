?Meh.?

But seriously, if I had known this was coming I would have spent the extra 2 seconds (times 300 friends) to go through and append the ?date? that I met everyone. Now all that time spent has been almost for no reason. On the good side, I was able to filter out like 10-20 people that I didn?t really have as friends.

Now this new feature requires me to go back and add the date to each person. In my honest opinion, Facebook should do a little bit of math to figure out when high/middle/elementary school was for me. That way I don?t have to go through dozens of contacts and add the years. You guys already know I graduated from Lakewood High School in ?04. Let?s put all those ?high school friends? somewhere near 2004?

Also, why does it assume that when I put ?met in an organization? that it was in the past? We?re still in that organization. So, unless I put a year in (the past) how about you a) assume it was this year and b) put ?You and ____ <strong>are</strong> (not were) members of _____??

The idea is pretty neat but right now it all seems a bit? cluttered. Since I have so many friends from only one or two years can we make it an iframe or something? Something that I could scroll if wanted but it?s so obnoxious. Perhaps making a ?wall? of friends above the categorization of them? That would look a bit neater I think. You could easily quadruple the number of people on each line then (thus saving precious scrolling time).

Can we start adding previous classes to this timeline? Like a new page on our profile to put all semesters of college? Then maybe it can start highlighting people that were simultaniously in those classes? This way I don?t have to manually think about who did what with me. They can add it to their own profile and then Facebook will do the dirty match-up work. Come on, make it easier for me, please? Plus, I feel I could start to trend how I met people (friends of friends from class last semester, etc). Can our current previous jobs and activites be included in this timeline profile (for the same reasons)? That way I don?t even have to pick a year (mentioned two paragraphs ago), Facebook figures it out for me, again.
Also, can you announce this to people the same way you announced the high school version of Facebook? (A message at the top to be ?hidden?) People will not find this very easily. In fact, I showed a few people today and they admitted they would never have noticed it in the first place.

Okay, thats enough stream of consciousness for now.
