While lots of people are changing <a href="http://www.pinkforoctober.org/">a few lines of CSS</a> I got up at 5:45am this morning to 'Go Pink' and help out. Denver hosts the largest <a href="http://www.komen.org/">Race for the Cure</a> in the nation and I lent a hand this morning.

This morning I was volunteering at the finish line handing out snacks to over 65,000 participants. It was intense, to say the least. Plus, I got to work with some neat Boy/Girl Scouts.

Overall, it was fun. If you don't volunteer you should. Really.

'Nuff said.
