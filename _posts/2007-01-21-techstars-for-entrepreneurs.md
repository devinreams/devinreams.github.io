Are you an entrepreneur looking to really get things started for you and your company (idea)? Luckily theres a group of [investors and mentors][1] in Boulder, Colorado here to help you this summer. Announcing, [TechStars 2007][2]&#8230;

## The Idea

It&#8217;s a multi step process:

*   take your idea and your team (up to three people) to TechStars and apply,
*   get accepted and get your money ($5,000 per team member),
*   get educated by some smart folks like [Brad Feld][3], [David Cohen][4], [Dave Taylor][5], and Ben Casnocha,
*   get your business running by the end of the summer

There are ten companies being accepted this summer with the application deadline being March 31st.

## Move to Boulder

You don&#8217;t have to reside in Boulder (nor Colorado for that matter) but it&#8217;s a good idea that you do. If you&#8217;re not around you don&#8217;t get to utilize the mentors and resources made available. CU Boulder has one of the best entrepreneurial business schools in the country. Plus, I can&#8217;t think of too many people who wouldn&#8217;t want to live in beautiful Boulder. Check out [this picture][6] I took a little while ago.

## In short&#8230;

If this sounds like [Y Combinator][7] to you, you&#8217;re absolutely right. But, I know some of the folks putting this on and I&#8217;d recommend it to any entrepreneur. You get seed funding, mentor sessions and any number of experts at your disposal. All they ask for is a 5% stake (they are investors, right?). If you&#8217;re looking for an excuse to get started&#8230; here it is!
