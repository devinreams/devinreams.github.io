If you didn&#8217;t know, my nickname is &#8216;Dreams&#8217;. Try and decode that one. Anyway, this past week I learned, did, and found a lot of cool things. Check it out:

**Monday**  
[**Dopplr added a carbon journal**][1] for travelers to realize how much they&#8217;re destroying the planet. Hooray!

**Tuesday**  
I found a nice little Mac app which I&#8217;ve been looking for since, oh, I owned a MacBook. It&#8217;s called [**I Love Stars**][2] and allows you to rate your iTunes songs from the menu bar.

**Wednesday**  
[**Communist parties**][3] are funny when cats are involved.

**Thursday**  
It was a big week for sports for me. I visited the [**Twins in Minneapolis**][4]. Saw them play the [**Rockies in Denver**][5]. Oh, and I went to a [**soccer game**][6] (Colorado vs. Salt Lake).

**Friday**  
I bought [**tickets to Colombia**][7]. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting experience and you know I&#8217;ll share my thoughts here.

If you haven&#8217;t already added me as a contact on [**Flickr**][8]&#8211;be sure to do so. Oh, and [**Twitter**][9], too.
