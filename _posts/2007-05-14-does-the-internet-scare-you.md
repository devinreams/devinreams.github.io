I love the internet. I&#8217;ve grown up with it. Even as a kid I remember being addicted to it. In fact, I sometimes forget how things got done before it was around. I can&#8217;t imagine what it was like to register for classes with a pencil and paper. It&#8217;s scary how much we rely on technology&#8230;

<!--more-->

But what&#8217;s more scary are those evil things going on. Of course, we all hear about the MySpace meetups where 16 year olds run off to meet their 40-year old cyber lovers. But what about those that keep their lives in the virtual world? That supposed harmless haven?

Have you heard of [Second Life][1]? Odds are you have. People say this online virtual world is changing the way people interact. With over [6 million][2] people conducting every-day transactions, lectures, and all-hands meetings it appears to be a pretty big deal.

But wait, it gets better. Now people are talking about **virtual rape**. [Wired reports][3] and [Melissa has more][4].

Go read the articles and let that sink in a minute.

It may or may not be a crime. That&#8217;s certainly up for debate. But the fact we&#8217;ve moved online, used it efficiently, then this? Why did this have to come along for the ride?

Have I mentioned&#8230; it&#8217;s virtual? Does this scare you? It scares the hell out of me&#8230;
