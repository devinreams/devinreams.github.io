Here again are some of the cool things I've found, done, or learned this past week:

<strong>Monday</strong>
For you iPhone users, <strong><a href="http://dev.c99.org/MobileScrobbler/">MobileScrobbler</a></strong> will scrobble (send data to last.fm) straight from your jailbroken iPhone. A bunch of other features include: lyrics, playlists and recommended tracks.

<strong>Tuesday</strong>
I'm a huge proponent of telecommuting. I hate spending a half-hour getting ready in the morning, shining my shoes, packing a lunch and then driving / riding the train maybe an hour each morning. That's 2 - 3 hours each day I could just as easily work from home! <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/06/09/telework-sun-runs-the-numbers/"><strong>Sun did a study on how much a day or two each week could save in energy.</strong></a>

<strong>Wednesday</strong>
I've started making fruit smoothies in the morning which is probably the best thing to happen to my routine (<a href="http://devinreams.com/blog/2007/03/11/morning-routines-rock/">I wrote about how important morning routines are</a>). It's as easy as buying some bananas, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries--then mixing it (in <a href="http://www.buythebullet.com/">The Magic Bullet </a>of course). Heck, make a pitcher's worth for the whole week. Thank me later.

<strong>Thursday</strong>
My Man in India (my <a href="http://devinreams.com/blog/2008/03/14/do-you-need-a-personal-assistant/">virtual assistant from GetFriday</a>) has done some fun tasks for me lately. For a few weeks I had him go into Facebook on Friday, see who had a birthday in the past week, and then send them a message. I love to send people these messages -- just to say hi -- but I figured it was a simple enough task to outsource. It went well, I had a few conversations with long lost friends. But! <a href="http://okdork.com/">Noah Kagan</a> was wished a happy birthday... a few months early.

<strong>Friday</strong>
<strong>Watch out for Linkedin address book imports.</strong> I accidentally (or was it meant to be?) invited my entire contact list to connect. But, again, I re-connected with some long lost friends (including an ex- from two years ago). I should get an award for most people 'recruited' to the darn site, though (at least 5 sign ups a day for a few days in a row).

Haha, that's all for this week... I'm off to Colombia by the time you read this. See you if / when I get back!
