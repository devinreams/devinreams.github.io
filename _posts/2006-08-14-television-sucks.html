<p>I assure you not everything I publish is a rant. I'm just feeling feisty lately... my latest target is television. A <a href="http://www.bradgarland.net/?p=141">few</a> <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/06/giving-up-tv/">peopl</a>e have described their experience with a month without TV and I'm following suit. My roommate and I had talked about dropping Comcast for months now because, frankly, that's too much money to pay for a lot of crappy channels. In this day and age I should be able to pick and choose. Since nobody is offering the a-la-carte TV package we decided to opt out entirely. Besides, we'd rather waste away in front of the computer than the television...</p>

<p>But seriously, if we are to spend any time in front of a television we decided we'd rather be watching movies. After surfing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> one day I realized there are a ton of flicks out there that I just never got around to seeing. This is where <a href="http://www.blockbuster.com/">Blockbuster Online</a> comes in. I already threw 10 movies in our queue last night and I'm excited to start watching them (on our 52" TV with 7.1 surround sound. Yay home theatre).</p>

<p>But the thing is, there are a ton of movies out there and I have no idea what they're about or if they're any good. This is where you guys come in. If you have any suggestions on movies that I <strong>must</strong> see, then leave a comment and I promise you I will. <a href="http://okdork.com/joe/">Joe</a> is first in line with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The Princess Bride</a>. In fact, if you haven't noticed, I set up a <a href="http://devinreams.com/movies/">Movies page</a> to document my experiences (most recent on the home page). So, help me out... <strong>What should I watch?</strong></p>
