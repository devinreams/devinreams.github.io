[DecodeDC][1] is my favorite new podcast and, appropriately enough, its all about politics. Self described as &#8220;deciphering Washington&#8217;s language and procedure so you can focus on what matters&#8221;,Â Andrea Seabrook has done a great job with the first four episodes diving in and pulling back the curtain on a lot of the status quo in Washington that the mainstream may not address (and fringe groups wouldn&#8217;t have access to, Seabrook was previously with NPR). If the last few months (or last night) sparked your interest in politics, I&#8217;d recommend checking out [DecodeDC][1].
