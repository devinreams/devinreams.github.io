For those of you who don&#8217;t speak nerd, I&#8217;m going to the South-by-Southwest Conference in Austin, TX on Friday (through Tuesday). I&#8217;ll be attending the &#8216;Interactive&#8217; conference which is a lot of people from the internet who think they&#8217;re forward thinking, amazing individuals.

In reality, it&#8217;s a lot of parties put on by a lot of hot new companies (everyone from Google to my Boulder buddies at [socialthing!][1]). Drinks, nerds, how can it go wrong?

I know a lot of cool people will be there (speaking and attending) and if you&#8217;ll be there too be sure to let me know:

*   **Phone:** 303-835-3512
*   **Email:** <devin@reams.com>
*   **Twitter:** [devinreams][2]

See you guys there.
