If you&#8217;re fed up with Google (qualms may include: [Search Plus Your World][1] providing useless results, changing privacy so you&#8217;re [tracked across products][2], [weird executives][3], etc.) it&#8217;s really easy to start using [DuckDuckGo][4] as your default search engine on your computer:

*   Safari: set hosts file to `184.72.115.86 search.yahoo.com` and change your default search engine to Yahoo
*   Chrome: visit [DuckDuckGo][5], right click address bar, `Edit Search Engines...`, find &#8220;DuckDuckGo&#8221;, click &#8220;Make Default&#8221;
*   Firefox: install [this Firefox Addon][6]
*   iOS device: install [this app][7]

I&#8217;ve been using it for a full day now and haven&#8217;t found any issue&#8230;

&#8230;well, truthfully, since the results are centered horizontally on the page I find myself having to move my mouse to the right a lot more. My muscle memory to immediately hover down and to the left once submitting a search query is surprisingly strong. Illustrated:

And why would you use DuckDuckGo? Well, they [don&#8217;t track you][8] (privacy) and [don&#8217;t bubble you][9] (relevance). And their logo is cute.
