People like <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/05/19/why-microsoft-will-buy-facebook-and-keep-it-closed/">Scoble still think Microsoft is going to drop something like $20 billion</a> on Facebook. A site with maybe $0.2 billion in revenue? Yeah, okay. Aside from what I like to call the decimal-place-mismatch let me explain why Facebook is not worth that much and why Zuckerberg is not a billionaire.

<strong>We aren't in a vacuum</strong>

There are many more variables to how <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=8084">Microsoft decides to drop $240 million</a> on a "stake." Sorry but you can't just say "oh, that's a percentage, let's multiply it."

I liken the situation to that of my friend who recently started a company and moved into 200 square feet of a 10,000 foot floor (for those of you playing at home, that's 2%). A generous businessman owns 10,000 of empty space and is renting 200 square feet for, let's say, $2,000/month. So can we say that each square foot is worth $10 and call it good? Sure. Wait, no--no we can't!

Just like we can't say each percentage of Facebook ownership is worth $150 million. Just like we can't say Zuckerberg's 30% puts him at $5 billion.

We can't cross-multiply-and-divide because we should consider the fact that

<ul><li>My friend has the bathrooms all to himself</li>
<li>My friend can be as loud as he wants</li>
<li>He can throw a party in the space and not compete for the "prime" space</li>
<li>There is no competition for resources like printers, power, corner offices, etc.</li>
<li>The infrastructure is already there to support him and his growth</li>
</ul>

To keep up with the metaphor, Microsoft can do at Facebook what my friend can do in his new office space. The money ($14.75 billion) isn't really there. Nobody went to Mark's bank account and deposited a billion dollars. Microsoft assigned a dollar amount to a percentage--but that dollar amount is coming with more than a "slice" of the pie. So we can't treat it like that. Stop doing that!

I know my point is simplistic but I'm a little annoyed (that this isn't the first time we're throwing around huge numbers at Facebook). This is why people like <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/2008/03/mark-zuckerberg-sarah-lacey-interview-disaster/">Sarah Lacey suck</a> and why <a href="http://scobleizer.com">Scoble</a> will never be one of those folks I ever listen to. Sorry to get personal but let's slow down and think about this...
