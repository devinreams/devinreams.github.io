If you want to quikcly search for something on a page you can simply type &#8216;/&#8217; and it will pull up the &#8216;Find&#8217; toolbar. If you&#8217;ve ever had to search a [man page][1] you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem understanding this one. I used to have the option &#8216;Begin finding when you begin typing&#8217; enabled but that quickly annoyed me when I&#8217;d accidently hit a letter and loose my place while reading.
