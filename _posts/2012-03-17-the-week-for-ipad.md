The Week is one of the most underrated magazines out there. I&#8217;ve been reading the paper version for years now so I&#8217;m very excited to see a well-executed weekly magazine done on the iPad. If you&#8217;d like a series of quick read articles on well-balanced issues and stories from the US and the world, check it out. It&#8217;s the only news source I need anymore these days&#8230;
