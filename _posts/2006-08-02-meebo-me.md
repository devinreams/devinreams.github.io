Many weeks ago I got a new computer and in order to cut down on useless, bloated programs I vowed not to install AIM. This is like my vow to never touch MySpace. Unfortunately there are still people that I want to access on AIM&#8230; but I don&#8217;t want to ever use AIM. In fact, my screenname (since middle school) has been: [devinhatesaim][1].

So, when I discovered Meebo a while back I was so excited! It&#8217;s a clean, simple, web-based instant message experience. Both of my buddy lists (GTalk, AIM) are combined and I have instant access to everyone. It&#8217;s great.

Meebo is a fun company, too. I love reading the blog and checking out the pictures from their events. This is certainly a fun, innovative group.

Which is why I was excited to see the [meebo me widget][2] this morning.

Load the widget onto your website (MySpace profile, blog, wherever) and visitors can instantly start chatting with you. Awesome! So, here&#8217;s mine for testing purposes, be sure to say hi.
