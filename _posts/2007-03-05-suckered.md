I hate the (RED) campaign and everyone associated with it (both the consumers and the companies advocating it). [Josh Spear][1] has posted a neat little news clip about it. CNN says:

<center>
  <strong>It has cost <font size=+1>$100M</font> to market the campaign while only raising <font size=-2>$18M</font> for charity.</strong>
</center>

No kidding? Get people to &#8220;give&#8221; more by spending more on themselves? Sigh.
