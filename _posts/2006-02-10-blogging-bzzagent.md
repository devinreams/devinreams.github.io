Seth points to the [90 Days of BzzAgent][1] blog. I&#8217;m **very **glad to see this. I had emailed Dave last year suggesting he harness the power of blogs (the BeeLog sucked). Heck, searching for &#8216;balter grapevine&#8217; turned up BusinessBits as the first result for quite some time. In any case, this is how Dave Balter described the 90 days blog in his email to John: *&#8220;It&#8217;s like a reality show.
