I&#8217;m a huge fan of simplicity; I&#8217;ve been working on de-cluttering, simplifying, and reducing the unnecessary in my life lately (which is why I&#8217;m in love with [Zen Habits][1]). I&#8217;ve started tracking the many things I want to do by using **[Joe&#8217;s Goals][2]**.

Joe&#8217;s Goals is a simple site where you set a goal (positive or negative), which days it applies to, it&#8217;s weighting (1 point? 2 points?) and then you have a simple grid with days across the top and goals across the side. As you complete a goal every day you check it. Joe&#8217;s Goals tracks this for me and serves as a simple checklist (with a history).

If you&#8217;re looking to start making change in your life, set up an account and set it as your homepage. I&#8217;ve done this and, again, being greeted (aware) of what you want to change is sometimes all it takes.
