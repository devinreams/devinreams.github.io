From [PaidContent.org][1], ?Since Kann became CEO in 1991, Dow Jones?s total return to shareholders has been 109 percent. By comparison, the New York Times Co. and the Washington Post Co. delivered returns of about 228 percent and 368 percent, respectively.? I would never have guessed. My lesson learned? Sometimes the percieved quality of a publication says nothing about the company.
