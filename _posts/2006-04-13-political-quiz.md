If you haven&#8217;t seen this [political quiz][1] yet I think you should give it a try. Put simply, 5 personal questions and 5 economic questions can determine your political orientation. Though, it&#8217;s not merely determining Red State/Blue State as many would love to think.

*(Side Note: That&#8217;s the problem with the masses and politics. Things start turning into teams. Teams are great but teams also act irrationally. For example, I live in Colorado so I&#8217;m a huge Bronco&#8217;s fan. It doesn&#8217;t matter who plays, how they play, etc., Broncos will always be the best. I&#8217;m pretty sure I love them becuase I have that team pride having lived in the state. I&#8217;m not alone, everyone does it. CU is the best at being as un-classy at demonstrating this. Frankly, breaking people into white vs. black is an American thing. Americans think there&#8217;s the good and the bad side. Why did we go to Iraq? We were good, they were bad. Putting things into context like that means less thought. I&#8217;m sorry, but there ****is** a middle ground. I&#8217;m convinced Americans don&#8217;t like to think).*

Anyway, I&#8217;m a Centrist. I&#8217;ve never associated myself with one &#8220;side&#8221;&#8230; I can support different ideas in different situations. So then&#8230; what are you? Was it much more different than you thought it would be? Some people have been surprised&#8230;
