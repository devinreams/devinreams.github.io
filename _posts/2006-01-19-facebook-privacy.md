Okay, I know I have a problem, but I was &#8216;poking&#8217; around on Facebook today (pun intended) and I usually click around and see if I can find anything new. It&#8217;s kinda hard to find out if there&#8217;s a change anywhere becuase Facebook doesn&#8217;t have a blog or anything (ahem, Noah?) but that&#8217;s okay, I clicked on &#8216;My Privacy&#8217; today and bam!, it&#8217;s different. I refreshed the home page like 20 times and haven&#8217;t seen any mention on the &#8216;Next Step&#8217; either.

I hated this page because it was like, 2047 check boxes with 32 different radio buttons to select. But now it&#8217;s narrowed our privacy settings down to &#8216;Normal&#8217;, &#8216;Reserved&#8217;, &#8216;Paranoid&#8217; or a custom mixture of options.

This seems like one of those little things, but for some it&#8217;s kinda a big deal. With a lot more people jumping on the site now (alumni, staff, even parents!) it&#8217;d be nice to make sure you can be as open as you want without the whole world knowing about you.

It also looks like you don&#8217;t need to know a person&#8217;s email address if you want to block them anymore. It&#8217;ll do a search for you and let you select them to be blocked. This is much simpler and almost one of those no-brainers&#8230; it&#8217;s about time.

Also, for those who aren&#8217;t yet married yet but are planning on it, it looks like &#8216;Engaged&#8217; has been added to the relationship status. Very exciting! I&#8217;m sure this applies to plenty of people. I already added a girl friend of mine as &#8216;Engaged&#8217;.

Since she already accepted it I don&#8217;t think I need to buy a ring&#8230;
