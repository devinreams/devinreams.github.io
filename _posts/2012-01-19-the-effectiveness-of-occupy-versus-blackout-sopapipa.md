Has anyone started to measure the effectiveness (attention, awareness, change) of the [Occupy movement][1] versus [blackout SOPA/PIPA][2]?

On one hand, Occupy Wall Street and the movements across the country gained plenty of media attention. With people physically taking over public spaces, standing on street corners, and getting pepper-sprayed, it was hard to miss. But was the point well received by the public at-large? Or congress? Or business? Was there a clear goal reached?

On the other hand, by &#8220;turning off&#8221; websites in order to protest the ability for organizations to&#8230; &#8220;turn off&#8221; websites, did the public miss the point? Did it turn people against Wikipedia (see [@herpderpedia][3])? Did it confuse visitors to Google? Or did it immediately capture the attention of millions of individuals with a few simple lines of code? Congresspeople have already started distancing themselves.

I wonder this because the two approaches appear to go about the same thing: protesting a government full of corporate mouthpieces with no real appreciation for what &#8220;real people&#8221; need. Police are trained to quash demonstrations and pepper-spray people, yet nobody but &#8220;the internet&#8221; can mess with the internet (yet..).
