I admit, I got a little burned out at work today (8 hours in front of the monitor, no lunch, pretty tough). So, I took a break and read a bit about [polyphasic sleep on Steve Pavlina&#8217;s blog][1]. I then dug around more and more and read some wikis and all sorts of articles. I&#8217;ve decided to embark on [Glen Rhodes&#8217; bi-phasic sleep pattern][2] and see how it works for me. I&#8217;ve never been much for sleeping a lot, but I&#8217;ve never really understood why I&#8217;m tired one day and just fine another. I&#8217;m looking into how I can schedule a routine 90-minute nap every day and then get 6 hours of sleep every night. The sleep cycles seem to make sense. If I get up at 6:30 every morning I could probably get a lot done in a day. Look out breakfast, I&#8217;m making a come-back..
