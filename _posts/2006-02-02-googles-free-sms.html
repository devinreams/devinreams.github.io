It looks like <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/send/sms/index.php">Google has done</a> what <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/01/14/teleflip/">teleflip</a> set out to do: free text messages sent online. Unfortunately you <em>do</em> need to know your recepient's provider. There's another catch: "we might also log the text of the message you send, in order to investigate and correct technical problems with the service". Uh oh.. has anyone called this <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/01/31/google-and-evil/">evil</a> yet?
