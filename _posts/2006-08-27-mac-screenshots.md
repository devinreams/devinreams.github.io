I thought it was so cool to learn that I could simply take screenshots by pressing Command, Shift 3. Even better was Command, Shift 4 which allowed me to pick the section of the screen to save. But, what I didn&#8217;t realize, was the fact that these images are compressed in a super crazy Apple way. I can open them (they&#8217;re just a PNG) and see them. Then I even copy/paste them into a PowerPoint. But, and here&#8217;s the kicker, when you try to open that PowerPoint in Windows it basically says these pictures are compressed and can&#8217;t be shown. Neat. I have to go re-take 27 screenshots for a presentation on Tuesday. Neat.
