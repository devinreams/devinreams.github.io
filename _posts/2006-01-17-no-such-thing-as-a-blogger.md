BoingBoing points out an awesome point: [there is no such thing as a blogger][1]. I do think of myself as a writer. I do it every day. I even find myself getting better every once and a while. In fact, my first class of the semester is tomorrow: business writing. I feel like the hardest part of the class will be the whole 8am part.
