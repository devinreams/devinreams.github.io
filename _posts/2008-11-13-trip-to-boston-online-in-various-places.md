Rachel and I took a quick trip to see friends in Boston, MA a few weeks ago. I&#8217;ve finally put the photos online. I love the various web applications out there, here&#8217;s how I used three to track my trip:

1.  [DOPPLR:][1] Used to see the &#8216;big picture&#8217; when it comes to travel. I&#8217;ve had the trip listed on [my travel profile][2] for a few weeks here. Magically, dopplr matches up travel dates to my Flickr timeline to show pictures from that trip. Easily one of the cooler features.
2.  [Flickr:][3] I uploaded all my photos with the permissions set to &#8216;me and family only&#8217;. So, all my pictures are archived and I can go back and essentially &#8216;unblock&#8217; the ones I want to share with everyone else. I don&#8217;t have a GPS-enabled SD card but I can manually geotag the location of these photos and have them show up on a map.
3.  [Brightkite:][4] Throughout the trip I would &#8216;check in&#8217; at the various spots we were at. Now I can go back and look at a [map view of my trip][5]. This helps with tagging photos but is also a really cool way to visualize a trip.

So there you have it. Three nerdy sites for one cool trip.
