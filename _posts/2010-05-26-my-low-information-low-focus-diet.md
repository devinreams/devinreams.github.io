Nicholas Carr wrote a [great article in WIRED about how the web may be destroying our focus][1] and rewiring our brains to consume information quickly and superficially. Thus, leaving little room for deep knowledge and understanding. In fact, this paragraph may already be too long and you&#8217;ve already moved on.

No matter. While I know that what he describes (the bad part) is very true for me and the way I interact with the web, I still want to do my best to continue to grow my long-term memory outside of it. I&#8217;ve always thought a low-information diet from a select number of sources would be way to achieve this and save some time. Tim Ferriss started me on this when he mentioned the concept in [The 4 Hour Work Week][2].

In short, I want to stick to a few key sources and avoid a whole slew of others. Just like any other diet, I aim for less carbs, more protein. Below I review my current information &#8220;diet&#8221; and evaluate the sources against Carr&#8217;s article.

### Where I regularly gain knowledge

#### National and international news

I read [The Week Magazine][3] every weekend (it comes in the mail by Saturday) and feel like I have a fairly comprehensive and balanced look at the most important happenings. The articles are concise and numerous which may not be conducive to long-term memory storage. I&#8217;m not sure how to gain a better depth while maintaining the breadth I enjoy.

**Fail**

#### Science and technology periodical

I&#8217;ve held on to over 11 years of [WIRED][4] magazines because it&#8217;s, well, the best. From the in-depth analysis of the Microsoft anti-trust case to Chris Anderson&#8217;s &#8220;long tail&#8221;, this magazine has been my must-read for as long as I can remember.

**Pass**

#### Technology news

There&#8217;s so much every day and very little of it matters. Despite disconnecting for three solid weeks when I was vacationing in Kenya, I missed near-to-nothing of substance. So, I stick to a handful key feeds like [Daring Fireball][5] and [Techmeme][6] for entertainment and conversational pieces, eg: what can I chat with my friends and colleagues about. But I really stick to them for the longer, in-depth pieces that occasionally come along. Plus, I never consciously click through to Gawker or TechCrunch.

**Pass**

#### Local news

I don&#8217;t care. I just talk to people around me, I suppose.

**Pass**

#### Non-fiction books

[I read][7] roughly one book per month which is probably more than the average person. It&#8217;s safe to say I prefer the book experience for information consumption, but read them less than I&#8217;d like (hence Carr&#8217;s article). Most books I read are related to business, technology, or sociology. I&#8217;m not very well rounded in this regard; I leave that to my better half. In short, I should read more books. 

**Pass</strong needing improvement</p> 
#### Video podcast

I love watching [TED Talks][8] more than anything. They give me something to strive for and broaden my understanding of the world. But, they&#8217;re short and leave more to be desired. The really good ones do a great job entertaining and getting a point across, but the take-away is usually only surface-level. Perhaps more follow-up (books to read?) is in store here.

**Fail**

#### Audio podcast

I listen to [This American Life][9] on my walk to/from work every morning for about 25 minutes. The hour-long stories around a single theme are an excellent way to gain deep understanding.

**Pass**

#### Twitter and Facebook

Twitter is like a chatroom collided with a stream of links. I try to look at Twitter only a handful of times a day. But, the content itself is nearly useless (informationally) and the only value I&#8217;ve found is social connectedness. Facebook is, well, Facebook.

**Fail** (but nobody can win)

### Conclusion

I need to work on my information diet just as much as I do my nutrition diet. Though I&#8217;ve consciously kept the quantity of sources low, the quality could be improved. First step: more books.

Does anyone here still like reading books and hearing about others&#8217; thoughts on them? Any source suggestions for any of the above areas?
