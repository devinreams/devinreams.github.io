I wanted to get some information on [Tourgasm][1], Dane Cook&#8217;s cleverly named comedy tour. When I visited the [**official** website][2] I was greeted with &#8220;The **official** trailer for the brand new HBO Comedy Documentary Series &#8211; Tourgasm!&#8221; When you hit Play you&#8217;re told the video has been removed for, get this, copyright infringement! YouTube, you piece of shit. You removed the **official** trailier. Look at [all these bootleg videos][3]! I&#8217;m sorry but I had to go to [MySpace][4] to watch the trailers. You know you&#8217;re done when MySpace does better than you&#8230;
