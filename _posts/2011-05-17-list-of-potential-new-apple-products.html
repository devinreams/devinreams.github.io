<a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/05/16/apple-planning-major-product-launch-for-10th-retail-anniversary/">If the rumors are true, Apple may be planning a new product launch to coincide with the 10th anniversary of their retail stores.</a> The stores have been wildly successful and much of Apple's growth may likely be attributed to them. So what can Apple release that would get bodies into the malls? What haven't they done already? Here's all I can come up with:

* Digital alarm clock
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_RAZR">Flip phone</a>
* Electric toothbrush
* <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/14/steve-jobs-calls-blu-ray-a-bag-of-hurt/">Blu-ray</a> player
* Video Game console
* Plasma TV
* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle">E Ink reader</a>
* Electric shaver
* Microwave
* [Vacuum](http://www.dyson.com/)
* Fridge
* Hybrid vehicle
* [Digital wristwatch](http://www.rolex.com/)
* 3D glasses
* <a href="http://designmuseum.org/design/dieter-rams">Vinyl record player</a>

That's the exhaustive list of items I've been able to compile. Who's ready to start some bets?
