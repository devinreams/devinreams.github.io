As Maine started to thaw out and the seven-foot snow pile melted down to three, Rachel and I packed our Prius :car: and aimed for Colorado.

Our fall and winter adventure was coming to an end but we still had one adventure left: driving cross country again. This time we opted to *quickly* see some different sights and new (to some of us) towns:

- Philadelphia, PA
- Baltimore, MD
- Washington D.C
- Lexington and Louisville, KY
- St. Louis, MO and
- Kansas City, MO

Some highlights included:

- seeing the historic Liberty Bell :bell:
- eating authentic cheesesteaks at Jim's :hamburger:
- running to (near, and not up, it's a long story..) the "Rocky Steps" :runner:
- sipping some rare brews at Monk's Cafe :beer:
- eating crab for lunch in Maryland :fish:
- driving by the NSA headquarters :mag:
- running around downtown Lexington and seeing the Mary-Todd Lincoln house :tophat:
- driving (and tasting) our way through Bourbon County, Kentucky :cocktail:
- visiting Churchill Downs :horse:
- watching KU practice before the NCAA Championships started :basketball:
- watching how bats are made at the Louisville Slugger Museum :baseball:
- waving to the Gateway Arch as we drove past St. Louis :wave:
- eating delicious BBQ in Kansas City :meat_on_bone:


We had a great time and made it back home to Denver in six (short?) days. Check out [our photos from driving home across the country](http://photos.devin.reams.me/driving-home-from-maine) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co/).
