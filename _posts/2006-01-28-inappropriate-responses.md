Scott nails it again: read his [inappropriate responses][1]. I often find myself caught in the &#8216;how are you loop&#8217; or I&#8217;ll pull one of these: &#8220;Hey Devin, whats up?&#8221; &#8220;Fine thanks, you?&#8221; I almost feel bad at that point but then I remember&#8230; most people don&#8217;t really care how you are nor want to really know what&#8217;s &#8216;up&#8217;. It&#8217;s just one of those &#8216;filler greetings&#8217;: a greeting that takes up more words than it needs to. My treatment of this superfluous Q&#038;A session often throws people off guard. Often in line at the grocery store it&#8217;ll go as such: &#8220;Hi there, how are you?&#8221; &#8220;Pretty good.&#8221; Which then leads to 20-60 seconds of awkward silence as the &#8220;momentum&#8221; of the conversation comes to a screeching halt. I just wonder why they didn&#8217;t ask something more meaningful like &#8220;So, looks like you&#8217;re out of toothpaste, sliced ham and milk? I go through that stuff pretty quickly too&#8221; or &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re the first teenager I&#8217;ve ever seen buy 12-dozen eggs and 14 rolls of toilet paper. Is that typical?&#8221;
