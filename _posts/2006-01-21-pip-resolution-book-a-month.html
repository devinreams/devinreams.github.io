Last year I resolved to read a book a month. I fell a few books short of my goal, unfortunately. In hindsight, I'm not sure why. I think the problem was with how I scheduled/used my time and that's obviously beginning to change this year.

With that said I'm going to go for a book each month again. First on the list is finishing The World Is Flat. I'm about a quarter through it (of 500 pages). As far as the following months are concerned, I've got a few books lying around here and then I'll head over to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/1DQNZ2USUEZYN">my own Amazon wishlist</a>. Naturally, I'll be posting my thoughts and reviews of each book.

Heck, with all my new free time I was able to catch up on 12 magazines. If I fail this I don't know what I'll do with myself...
