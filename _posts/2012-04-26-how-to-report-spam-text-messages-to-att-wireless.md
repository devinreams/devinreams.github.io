**Short answer: forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) then reply back with the number it originated from.**

The business-minded folks over at AT&T have yet again gone out of their way to try and squeeze extra money out of their &#8220;already-paying-near-cartel-prices&#8221; customers. I knew they were greedy but the last straw was when I realized they charge extra for the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of tethering an internet connection (wired or wireless) through your mobile device *in addition to* the cost for the additional data. Really? My data allotment is data no matter how it goes through my devices, why do they get to charge for a *software feature* of my wireless phone?

Then&#8230; then today I received a terribly annoying spam text message:

<img src="https://devin.reams.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1554-340x510.png" alt="" title="Spam Text Message" width="340" height="510" class="aligncenter size-medium-img wp-image-4218" />

After searching DuckDuckGo and Google, AT&T&#8217;s own customer forums come up (with people helping each other out), after [their official FAQ page][1].

Thus, if I were to rely entirely on AT&T through its official support channels I would be greeted with a lengthy explanation as to what spam messages are, what the sources may be, and how I can prevent them:

<dl id="attachment_4219" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:510px">

    <a href="https://devin.reams.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ATT-IRU-Wireless-Block-spam-text-messages-on-your-wireless-phone.png"><img src="https://devin.reams.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ATT-IRU-Wireless-Block-spam-text-messages-on-your-wireless-phone-510x479.png" alt="" title="AT&T Wireless: Block spam text messages on your wireless phone" width="510" height="479" class="size-medium-img wp-image-4219" /></a>

The best part: it dedicates much of the page to terrible suggestions (send &#8220;STOP&#8221; back to a spammer?) and then (for wireless number text messages) **they suggest you pay for &#8220;AT&T Smart Limits&#8221;** which is a $4.99 / month package to block specific numbers **before** mentioning it has a responsible method to report spam.

So, if I&#8217;m a typical user I skim the page, see a solution (oh, set up &#8220;Limits&#8221; and add the number, great!), stop reading and now AT&T takes more of my money. At least, I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s the hope based on the way this helpful page is designed. It doesn&#8217;t seem like AT&T is dedicated to reducing spam, it appears to be in a conflict of interest: it&#8217;s in their best interest for more people to receive unwanted spam messages in order to continue promoting an additional paid service.

Disgraceful.

I&#8217;ll be switching to [Verizon Wireless][2] once my contract is up.
