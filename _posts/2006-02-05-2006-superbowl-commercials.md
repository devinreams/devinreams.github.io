Being a Denver fan (and resident) I felt it was only necessary to root for the guys who beat us (Steelers). My logic brings me to the conclusion that we were #3 this season. Way to grab the bronze, Broncos! Anyway, I was simultanously doing other things during the game tonight but luckily I can [download all the commercials into iTunes][1]. PS: How cute was that clydesdale one?
