On February 22, 2014 I will be skiing on &#8220;Team Breck&#8221; at [Hope on the Slopes][1] in Breckenridge. Hope on the Slopes, Ski & Ride for a Cure is a fundraising event for skiers and boarders, held at ski areas around the country. Proceeds benefit the American Cancer Society (ACS), and support their mission to eliminate cancer as a major health problem through prevention, saving lives, and diminishing suffering from cancer through research, education, advocacy and service.

Cancer has affected my family and, more recently, a [friend][2]. If you&#8217;d like to donate towards my team please feel free to use [this link][3].
