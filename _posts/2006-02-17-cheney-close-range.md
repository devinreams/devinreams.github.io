[Here&#8217;s an interesting report concluding that Cheney&#8217;s shot was between 15 and 18 feet, not the reported 90][1]. My only question is: why would they lie? **What difference does the distance make?** Either way, as Jon Stewart so eloquently put it, *the Vice President shot a 78-year old man in the face*.
