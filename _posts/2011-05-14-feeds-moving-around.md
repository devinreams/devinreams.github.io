For a handful of reasons, mostly the fact I want to &#8220;own&#8221; my own feed and data, I&#8217;m redirecting my feed back away from Google&#8217;s Feedburner and using \[Mint analytics\](<a href="http://haveamint.com" rel="nofollow">http://haveamint.com</a>) to track subscribers and feed item click-throughs. If you notice anything screwy please \[let me know\](mailto:devin@reams.me).
