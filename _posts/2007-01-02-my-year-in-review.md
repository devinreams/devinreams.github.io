The year has come to an end. A lot went on for me. I&#8217;ve landed a job after college, worked seven jobs at once, helped run a professional fraternity of over 130 people, joined 9rules, left b5media, met new people, learned new things. It&#8217;s been fun.

## Statistics

My site has shown significant improvement and growth. At the beginning of the year I was used to writing shorter posts &#8212; they weren&#8217;t the highest quality. As time went on I learned what worked best for the site and its readers. **I started with 50 subscribers and am now around 250**; some obvious growth.

Additionally, I&#8217;ve tracked my incoming traffic with [Mint][3] which has also shown constant growth. I&#8217;ve gone from 2,250 unique visitors each month to 4,500. With that said, **2006 brought me 32,950 unique visitors and 74,545 page views**. Numbers that still amaze me.

As far as the site goes, last year I wrote 321 posts which received 689 comments. Certainly an accomplishment for my first year of blogging. In the year&#8217;s time I&#8217;ve served up some decent content which has also earned me first on Google when searching for &#8216;[devin][4]&#8216;. I beat out the porn star, politician, and guy who owns devin.com. Man, I&#8217;m good&#8230;

## Best of the Year

I&#8217;ve had a lot of people visit my site for different reasons. My top reason this year was to learn about the [FIRO-B][5] assessment. Unfortunately there were some issues with the way I presented their material so they kindly (C&#038;D letter) asked me to take it all down.

The second biggest draw was for information about [biphasic sleep][6]. I&#8217;ve been maintaining this nap/sleep routine since January (I don&#8217;t nap much over break though) and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. It made for a great discussion during some interviews this year. Oh, and someone linked to me on [Wikipedia][7] &#8212; that was neat to see.

A lot of people also arrived here recently to learn about [Miss Dewey][8], many other want to know about MySpace and why it&#8217;s so worthless. In any case, a lot of people have visited for a lot of different reasons and I&#8217;m glad my site has proved some worth to them.

## Personal Improvement Plan

I started doing a few things this year to help myself get organized, get productive, and get all-around better. This including making todo lists (which turned into calendaring and scheduling), biphasic sleep, working out more and reading more.

I think I very well across all fields except the last. I haven&#8217;t read nearly as much as I had planned. In fact, I set aside a goal of a book every month. I think I read four new books this year. I intend to resolve that with a better plan. As far as other areas of improvement? I&#8217;m not sure what I want to do &#8212; I simply want to remedy my previous goal.

## Future Plans

I hope to make a few changes to allow me to focus more. Here are the major areas of my life in the coming months and what I hope to do across all of them:

*   **Academics**: I started to lose motivation at the end of the last semester because I had a lot going on, was working hard with little reward, and was already in the process of signing onto a job for next Fall. This semester I plan to bring my laptop to class and type diligent notes. I&#8217;ve realized that the art of typing/writing what you learn really helps solidify your understanding.
*   **Work**: My current job presents me with lots to do but sometimes not a lot to learn. I will seek out new opportunities to gain new experiences. I also hope to keep doing some web projects on the side.
*   **[AKPsi][10]**: I&#8217;m the VP of Membership meaning I run the rush/pledge programs. The goal is to have the majority of the semester planned right now (over break) so that I don&#8217;t consume too much time during school.
*   **DevinReams.com**: My site is named after myself, I feel like I should talk a bit more about myself. I plan to do a &#8216;Week in Review&#8217; every Friday to reflect and document how things are going. Some people may browse past it, others may find it interesting to get to know me a bit more. It will go a bit better than [Mind Averse][11] (daily video blog) did.
*   **Mind Averse**: Instead of making a daily video blog I intend to turn this into a quasi-documentary as I explore the books I&#8217;m reading. [I feel a lot more can be done with video][12] and I hope this project (starting February) will take off.
*   **Colorado Snow Blog**: As I start skiing more I hope to blog more about Colorado snow sports, resorts, etc. I&#8217;d also like to find some additional authors that would like to contribute.
*   **Life With Women**: I enjoy making this comic strip and I hope to work on Fridays to create two new strips each month. So far the responses have been positive, I just need to learn to draw and be humorous.
*   **Yopos**: This is no longer about young professionals unfortunately. The community wasn&#8217;t as strong as I had hoped. Instead it&#8217;s turned into a fun podcast that Noah and I work on. I intend to keep doing this every week.

Obviously I&#8217;ve got some plans. I&#8217;ve been writing down stuff as I think of it. Setting dates and deadlines. As [Tyme has mentioned][13], you need to have some sort of plan. Sure, you can set lofty goals but you need to be able to measure your success. That&#8217;s certainly something I&#8217;ve learned this year. I&#8217;ve tried a bunch of things and realized what works, what I like, etc. **Happy New Year!**
