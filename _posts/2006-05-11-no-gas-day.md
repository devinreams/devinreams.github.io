[Noah][1] approached me with an interesting idea: **No Gas Day**.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <a href="http://5thirtyone.com/archives/288"><img width="120" height="45" border="0" id="image266" alt="No Gas Day" src="https://devin.rea.ms/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/nogas.gif" /></a>
</div>

It&#8217;s simple, try your best to not use gas on** May 22nd**. That&#8217;s the day Noah has chosen. I think that one day isn&#8217;t enough, think of it as January 1st: it&#8217;s a day to make a resolution. Starting May 22nd I resolve to use less gas. Not becuase I hate Exxon, not becuase I think it&#8217;s bad for the environment: it&#8217;s bad for me!

I&#8217;m spending an extra $10 to fill my tank than I did last year. I drive enough that I have to fill up every 2 or 3 weeks. Some simple math shows that I&#8217;m out over $250 each year because prices have shifted. Economics suggests I need to shift my demand (or supply, whichever way you see it) curve and use a bit less. It really can&#8217;t be too hard, I have a free bus pass for goodness sakes!

I&#8217;ve seen a few petitions and things spread around but this is different. This is a blog meme: something that we hope to pass around the internet through bloggers. If blogs <u>are</u> as powerful as they say they are then why wouldn&#8217;t something like this get noticed? I&#8217;m thinking social change here, not a &#8220;lets lower gas prices by collectively complaining.&#8221; I see this as an opportunity to start thinking differently about usage. So, why wouldn&#8217;t every blogger make a little post tagged &#8220;nogasday&#8221; and spread the idea?

Seriously, bloggers are (for the most part) very self-centered and are only interested in a) their taffic, b) their earnings, c) theirselves or any mixture of the three. Why else do you think I have the Feedburner button over on the right side of my site?

My point is this: I wish a few bloggers would see some value in spreading this idea. It&#8217;s not an attempt to get the government/oil companies/prices to change. It&#8217;s an attempt to get ourselves to change. Who deserves a break more than I do? I wish some people out there had some interesting conservation ideas/tips/stories.

Anyway, I&#8217;ll be very interested to see if a) enough people would be willing to post their thoughts about this and b) actively resolve to make some sort of change next week.

Here&#8217;s [Noah&#8217;s original post][2] (with very interesting comments) and here&#8217;s [Derek&#8217;s post][3] with buttons made available.
