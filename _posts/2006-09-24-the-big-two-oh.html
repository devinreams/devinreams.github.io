This article may be misleading, when I talk about two-oh I don't mean (Web) 2.0, I mean twenty, my age as of today. It's a nice round number but that's about all this birthday has going for it. Honestly, I can see why people stop looking forward to their birthdays as life goes on.

<h2>Twenty is a tease</h2><!--more-->

I don't mean to sound so cynical, I'm just making a point: 20 is useless. I thought 19 was bad but 20 is a total tease. It doesn't help when everyone I associate with is at least 21 if not 22 or older. Even the other day I was quickly reminded how terrible this is. When asking about tips for a first date it was recommended I take someone to get a drink.

Sure, maybe a rum and coke. She'll get the rum, I'll drink the coke.

<h2>Reflections</h2>
But, thats not to say the last year (and the year to come) are all that bad. Since my last birthday I've certainly changed. I've been the Vice President of <a href="http://www.cuakpsi.com/">AKPsi</a> which has taught me a lot. I co-founded <a href="http://www.yopos.com">yopos</a> which has introduced me to so many people I can't even begin to list them. I've started my own webcomic, I've been on the Dean's List again, I've joined Beta Gamma Sigma (honor society). I've held a number of jobs and learned a lot. I've even changed my major from Information Systems to Accounting.

But it hasn't all been good. I no longer talk to a close (ex girl-) friend. That's certainly been a learning experience in itself. Not just about relationships or people but myself as well.

But enough boring stuff. Thanks to everyone who left their best wishes. I'm thinking of doing a (semi) daily video log. Not to entertain necessairly but just so I have an archieve of me and life. We'll see how that goes...

365 and counting...
