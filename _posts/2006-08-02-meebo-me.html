Many weeks ago I got a new computer and in order to cut down on useless, bloated programs I vowed not to install AIM. This is like my vow to never touch MySpace. Unfortunately there are still people that I want to access on AIM... but I don't want to ever use AIM. In fact, my screenname (since middle school) has been: <a href="aim:devinhatesaim">devinhatesaim</a>.

So, when I discovered Meebo a while back I was so excited! It's a clean, simple, web-based instant message experience. Both of my buddy lists (GTalk, AIM) are combined and I have instant access to everyone. It's great.

Meebo is a fun company, too. I love reading the blog and checking out the pictures from their events. This is certainly a fun, innovative group.

Which is why I was excited to see the <a href="http://blog.meebo.com/?p=175#comments">meebo me widget</a> this morning.

Load the widget onto your website (MySpace profile, blog, wherever) and visitors can instantly start chatting with you. Awesome! So, here's mine for testing purposes, be sure to say hi.
