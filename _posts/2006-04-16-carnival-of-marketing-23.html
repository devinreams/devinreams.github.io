This week I'm hosting the <a href="http://okdork.com/grand-opening-carnival-of-marketing/">Carnival of Marketing</a> and I've got 7 great articles to share with you. Enjoy!

<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/04/marketing_in_th.html">Seth Godin - Marketing in the Car Business</a>
<blockquote>"We should not try to educate or teach the customer about what he or she wants." Oh.</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.4syndication.com/content.do?id=6764&blog=17">The Fast Growth Blog - Are Your Employees "Raving Fans?"</a>
<blockquote>"Think about all of the money spent on marketing and sales -- all of the ?customer outreach? initiatives, loyalty programs, special offers, etc. How much money is spent to support making employees ?raving fans? of the employer?"</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.jslogan.com/content/view/255/1/">Jim Logan - Stop Playing It Safe, you're Boring Us To Death!</a>
<blockquote>Odds favor that whatever your competition is doing to build their business is exactly what you shouldn?t be doing.</blockquote>
<a href="http://careerintensity.com/blog/2006/04/15/get-a-new-job-offer-every-month/">Career Intensity Blog - Get A New Job Offer Every Month</a>
<blockquote>Creating opportunity is not just a good idea ? it is your responsibility.  How many job offers (or new pieces of business for you entrepreneurs) have you received this year?</blockquote>
<a href="http://firesomeonetoday.com/blog/archives/2006/04/authentic_adver_1.html">Fire Someone Today - Authentic advertising, cyborg style</a>
<blockquote>A pretty girl wearing a video screen is as blatant a ?look at me!? advertisement  as there is. But it is also a chance to tell a story, because unlike a poster or  billboard, your live saleslady can actually talk to your customers. Maybe she  should get to try the product.</blockquote>
<a href="http://7cmarketing.supremeserver20.com/blog/2006/04/importance-of-using-keywords-in-blogs.html">7CM Marketing Blog - The Importance of Using Keywords In Blogs</a>
<blockquote>Choose a few keywords or short phrases, and work them into your blog entry. Don't over do it! Nobody wants to read a blog that's just an obvious set of keywords.</blockquote>
...and to finish off the day with a post with some Easter Sunday relevance:

<a href="http://churchrelevance.com/2006/04/15/how-to-find-a-church-for-easter/">Church Relevance - How to Find a Church for Easter</a>
<blockquote>?If I never went to church, how would I know when to show up on time??</blockquote>
