I swear, any time that I decide I want to check out MySpace (only means of communication with some in-duh-viduals) it's broken. I click a page, it says "error, under maintainance" I say "liar" and refresh and, wow, page magically loads. For being one of the most popular websites <em>ever</em> how the fuck is this acceptable? If someone is making a MySpace killer, for goodness sakes, email me and let's fix this? (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/200454882/">Check out this picture from my account settings</a>)
