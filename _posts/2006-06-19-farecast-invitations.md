Anyone interested in testing out [Farecast][1]? It&#8217;s a very nice (beautiful, functional) website to help predict and find the best fares based on price histories. Right now it only serves Seattle/Boston markets but it&#8217;s great to play around with. I have a bunch of invites; just leave a comment.
