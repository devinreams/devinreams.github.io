This is a dual-purpose post. First, my song of the day is called 'Hardcore Days & Softcore Nights' by Aqueduct. It's a really neat song but unfortunately the lyrics didn't turn up on Google at all. I knew I had the song, but couldn't find it! So, if you're looking for a catchy indie song that repeats "don't ever ask me where I go" and "don't ever ask me where I'm from", this is your song.
