I?d like to revisit my desk briefly while I show you my decorative space-saver. As mentioned, I call it my ?phone tree? and you can see it here:
<div style="text-align: center"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/84290671/"><img width="194" height="259" border="0" title="Phone Tree" alt="Phone Tree" src="http://static.flickr.com/37/84290671_4c57d7e14f.jpg?v=0" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: center">(Click for larger, annotated view from Flickr)</div>
The following elements are necessary to ensure a successful ?phone tree?:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Decorative flora placed on a surface:</strong> A quick google search for ?<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=eJC&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=small+artificial+tree+-christmas&btnG=Search">small artificial tree -christmas</a>? turned up some nice looking trees and plants. From a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.earthflora.com/store/cart.php?target=product&product_id=20172&category_id=934">little fern</a> to a <a href="http://www.bonsaiboy.com/catalog/product970.html">small cherry blossom tree</a> I?m sure you can find a nice looking plant to tuck your phone into at any local hobby store as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Phone charger discreetly hidden into the plant:</strong> When not in use you don?t want an unsightly cable pertruding. You?re clever, find a cool way to hide it in there.</li>
	<li><strong>Headset or similar accessory/ies that may also keep a low profile: </strong>As you can see on my tree I can just lay the headset over the tree ?leaves? and it blends right in. In addition, I set my lint-free wipe cloth on the base. Now I can talk to people and use my freed-up hands to clean off smudges!</li>
</ul>
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my ideas as much as I have. The tree is not only decorative but practical. If you decide to make your own tree be sure to leave a link in the comments.
