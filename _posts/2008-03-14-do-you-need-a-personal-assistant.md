There&#8217;s a new lifestyle experiment circling the world right now: personal assistants (on the other side of the world). Tim Ferriss definitely popularized this concept with his book [The 4-Hour Workweek][1].

As I sat and read the book I was in the mindset that &#8220;I&#8217;m a simple guy, I will never need an assistant.&#8221; In hindsight, I realize that was the wrong way to consider the idea. For some reason we&#8217;re of the thought that a lot of tasks we do are essentially &#8220;ours&#8221; that no one else could take over. That&#8217;s ultimately wrong.

Take e-mail for example: Tim has even outsourced (through a series of rules) his own email. You and I aren&#8217;t in the same position as Tim but think about other mundane tasks that can easily be translated to an assistant:

*   Booking travel (15 minutes)
*   Researching the iPhone and how to jailbreak it for T-Mobile usage (15 minutes)
*   Researching the pro/cons of upgrading to a Macbook Pro (15 minutes)
*   Researching the pros/cons of trying FireFox Beta 4 and if my addons will work with it (10 minutes)
*   Monitor my financial accounts weekly and pay credit cards monthly (15 minutes)
*   Write a nice thank you/nice to meet you note for people met at SXSW (15 minutes)
*   Contact a company to get a refund (10 minutes)
*   Contact another company to get a new download/activation code (10 minutes)

I created that list during the first two hours of my Friday morning. I put myself in the mindset: **if I had an assistant right now, what would I ask them to do for me?** I&#8217;ve already come up with almost 2 hours worth of work&#8230; during my two hours of work. That seems like a compelling reason to consider it.
