I can&#8217;t believe the ski season has already been in full swing for a few weeks now. To help kick the season off I authored a guest post over on the [Breckenridge Blog][1] talking about the [art (science?) of snow forecasting and how snowfall is reported at Breckenridge][2]. I plan to do a number of guest posts this season and expand some of my &#8220;snow writing&#8221;. Stay tuned&#8230;
