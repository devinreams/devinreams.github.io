I can&#8217;t stop thinking how easy it could potentially be to truly &#8220;disrupt&#8221; the airline industry. [Judge Gomila looks at a number of aspects of flying][1] that don&#8217;t make sense:

> It would be silly if you had to recheck all safety tests with an independent agency before driving a car every single time. Having to watch the simple safety instructions every flight is a waste of time and energy for the passenger. No one even watches it anyway. We need to take this online and out of the cabin, making it a test that people hold a license for, rather like a driving license.

I know the aviation industry is something [Horace Deidu has been thinking about recently][2], too. It encourages me to see smart folks talking about these things in addition to folks like [BlackJet][3] creating (admittedly, less accessible) stepping stones in the meantime.
