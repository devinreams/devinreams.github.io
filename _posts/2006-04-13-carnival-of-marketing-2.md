I apologize for my absence. I was gone for 4 days, had work, school (midterm, presentation), and tonight I had a concert. In short, I&#8217;ve been oh-so-busy lately.

But that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m writing. I&#8217;m here to remind everyone that the [Carnival of Marketing][1] will be hosted by yours truly next week. At first, I didn&#8217;t even understand what a Carnival was but it&#8217;s quite simple: write something insightful, new, and/or interesting and I will gladly spotlight your post right here. The point is, I host the carnival and you&#8217;re one of the rides. People stop by here because they know I&#8217;ve collected the best rides the internet has to offer.  
For example, a few weeks ago I wrote [Market to College Students][2]. I was in the Carnival and I received a bunch of traffic/subscribers.

So, if you have something you&#8217;d like for me to mention just shoot me an email (devin@reams.me). It&#8217;s really that simple. I look forward to the submissions!
