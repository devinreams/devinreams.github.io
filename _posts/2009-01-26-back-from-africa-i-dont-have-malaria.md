We got back from a long vacation to Kenya for a safari. The trip was December 19th &#8211; January 9th. I had an awesome time and I now have 1,800+ pictures to go sort through. Plus another 40-50 minutes of HD video to edit, post online, etc.

But the scary part was coming back home and having flu-like symptoms. I figured &#8220;well I never get sick, what can this be&#8221; so I checked with the doctor. He did a flu test and the results came back negative. What&#8217;s left? Some random bug or malaria.

It wasn&#8217;t malaria.

But that would&#8217;ve been a pretty sweet story, eh?

Check out some of the [safari highlights][1] on Flickr and I&#8217;ll add the rest as I get some time.
