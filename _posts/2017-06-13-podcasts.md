I've been a podcast listener since shortly after Apple introduced the concept (into iTunes late in 2005). I recently took stock of what I regularly listen to and found I subscribe to 26 podcasts...

Little known fact: I co-hosted a podcast with [Noah Kagan](http://okdork.com/) in 2006 called [yopos](https://web.archive.org/web/*/yopos.com) (the "Cast of Pod" content has luckily been archived by the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20060719023806/http://yopos.com:80/2006/07/06/cast-of-pod-4-ken-lay-pennies-and-ads/)).

I was asked to list the podcasts I (still) listen to today, over a decade later:

- This American Life
- The Talk Show with John Gruber
- The Critical Path
- Reply All
- Pod Save America
- What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law
- DecodeDC
- Lovett or Leave It
- The Information's 411
- Hark
- a16z
- StartUp Podcast
- Song Exploder
- Serial
- S-Town
- Revisionist History
- Radiolab
- 99% Invisible
- Planet Money
- Fresh Air
- Stuff You Should Know
- 2 Dope Queens
- Track Changes
- Turnpikers
- Accidental Tech Podcast
- Stop & Taste Conversations

While primarily tech-oriented, I also have a big interest in politics and science. What are you listening to? How do you find new podcasts to listen to?
