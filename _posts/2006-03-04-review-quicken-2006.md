I decided to get somewhat ambitious, [as you may have noticed][1], and went through all my finances. I decided it was time to see what the wonderful world of Quicken was like. I must say, it&#8217;s a very pretty world.

Using 2006 Deluxe has been a pleasure so far. It&#8217;s much more, me-oriented than Microsoft Money. When I started using this software my first reaction was &#8220;Microsoft has made some pretty lazy software&#8221;. Quicken greeted me with the ability to set goals. I told it I would like to:

*   [<img width="100" height="70" border="0" align="right" alt="Setting Goals" src="http://static.flickr.com/36/107484947_a5fd72b913_t.jpg" />][2]Manage my checkbook and bills
*   Know where my money is going
*   Save more money
*   Track all of my investments in one place, and
*   Know my net worth

In hindsight I don&#8217;t know if I really wanted to know the last one. It&#8217;s slightly disappointing. In any case, once the goals are set it walks you through setting up your accounts. The &#8216;Direct Connect&#8217; feature seems a million times more functional than Money&#8217;s. It tells me more than &#8216;Error&#8217; when and if there&#8217;s an issue. Money just sits with a turning wheel while something, unbeknownst to me, goes on in the background.

Once I had my accounts neatly setup and downloaded, I unfortunately had to go through and setup the categorization/memorized payees. Quicken doesn&#8217;t download QIF data anymore because it&#8217;s, apparently, an outdated standard used for troubleshooting; not downloading transactions. I didn&#8217;t mind, though. It allowed me to make sure there was consistency throughout hundreds of transactions.

Some things I really like include:

*   [<img width="76" height="100" border="0" align="right" alt="Account Bar" src="http://static.flickr.com/53/107486415_6baed891f8_t.jpg" />][3]**Account Bar:** it&#8217;s always on the screen, tells me my account values and lets me quickly switch between them.
*   **Portfolio/Investments:** Quicken pulls up a very nice, stat-filled screen for each security I own. The market value/price graph doesn&#8217;t crash the program either (as Money did as it tried to download the data) because it uses previously downloaded values.
*   **Pin Vault:** This feature allows me to save my PINs and then lock them with a single password. Money could save all the PINs automatically but this additional security feature is nice.
*   [<img width="161" height="240" border="0" align="right" alt="Budget Setup" src="http://static.flickr.com/35/107484948_ccbde64d86_m.jpg" />][4]**GUI:** Microsoft&#8217;s blue is nice, but the subtle shadows make this a very attractive program. The graphs are pretty, the tabs are intuitive. It looks good and that&#8217;s important.
*   **Reports:** I haven&#8217;t even had a chance to go through all of these but they&#8217;re all very useful and I can&#8217;t wait to create some useful analysis.
*   **Budget:** Quicken&#8217;s seems like there&#8217;s much more to it. Money would simply ask how often I would spend X dollars in Y category. It would then just apply it as a monthly average value. Quicken allows me to do either that, or by month or quarter. In other words, instead of budgeting $7.45 each month for &#8216;Christmas Gifts&#8217; I can tell it I only expect to spend $100 in December.
*   **Reconcile:** I don&#8217;t think Money even had this feature. It helped me figure out which transaction I accidently deleted. All I had to do was pull up my online statement for January and I could quickly find the loss.

Obviously I&#8217;m enjoying playing around with my new program. I previously wrote about using Money to track your money. After two days I&#8217;d recommend Quicken to anyone out there looking for a very nice personal finance program.
