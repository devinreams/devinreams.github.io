I'm excited to announce I'm joining Mozilla in April to help manage an engineering team!

I think my history with Mozilla technically begins with [Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) (the basis to the [Firefox web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)) in the late 90's. Later on I became a volunteer editor of (now Aol's) soon-to-be-retired [dmoz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMOZ) (website directory) helping maintain high-level topics under the nickname [devdev](http://www.dmoz.org/public/profile?editor=devdev).

Many years later I'm officially becoming a Mozillian and joining the [mission of building a better internet](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/). I'll be working within Firefox's üî•ü¶äüåç engineering organization to lead a new team building something that I'm very passionate about: a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager).

I'm not the only one who struggles to maintain hundreds of unique, complex passwords across multiple sites. On top of that, I don't know which sites have recently been hacked and where my password needs to be changed. These problems only begin to scratch the surface of what we all need solved...

As the internet becomes more complex and our lives more dependent on it: security and identity are going to be extremely important and I'd love to help be a part of building this stuff (better).

Sadly this means my last day at GitHub :octocat: is next Friday, March 24th.

I was so lucky to find and join such an amazing company. I've been especially privileged to get to work with and help build teams with so many wonderful and brilliant people (and now friends). I can easily say that GitHub, both its product and mission, are something I'll truly miss being a part of.

I owe a _huge_ "thank you" to everyone who worked with me and for me, took risks on me, were patient with me, and taught me so much over the last 3 years (only 3? it feels like 13!). I'll always value what we did together and will never forget it.

I'm sad to leave but very excited to start this new journey. I'll be moving much closer to both product engineering and decisions that could affect millions of people around the world (and make it a better place). Maybe I'll get a chance to brush up on my JavaScript skills, too. :wink:

I wish the best of luck to everyone at GitHub and look forward to joining the team at Mozilla. Onward! :rocket:
