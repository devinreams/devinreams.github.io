This is a [great series of maps (explaining the Middle East)][1] and really showing what [Vox][2] is all about. I learned quite a bit from it. It may sound silly but it also helped me realize how interrelated the various timelines, histories and events covered in high school really affected the world we have today. Learning &#8220;European history&#8221; seemed so distant from modern day events but these maps and explanations helped some things &#8220;click&#8221; back together for me.
