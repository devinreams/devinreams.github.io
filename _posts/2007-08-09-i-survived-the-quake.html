I survived <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-quake10aug10,0,7759670.story?coll=la-home-center">the quake in LA</a> last night. I was lying in bed and around 1:00am I took off my headphones; something weird happened to my bed. I couldn't explain it but I remember my room making a loud creak and pop a few minutes later. Fun!
