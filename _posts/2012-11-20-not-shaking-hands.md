David Cohen has a good observation about shaking hands:

> The handshake is thought to have developed as a gesture of peace, to show that neither side was carrying a weapon in their right hand. Since I’m not really afraid that anyone I meet at a conference will be carrying a spear, you’d think we could just move past this tradition.

I&#8217;ve tried pre-empting friends and folks I&#8217;ve met before with a [fist-bump][1] to avoid the germy, awkward palm-to-plam interaction. It&#8217;s less-often received as &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; or a cultural &#8220;faux pas&#8221; and I can&#8217;t help but think [President Obama][2] is mostly to thank for that. But new encounters don&#8217;t feel right with a bump&#8230; for now.
