An [amazing rebuttal][1] to everything I&#8217;ve come to know and appreciate about milk (good for you, drink lots of it, etc.) over at NYTimes.com:

> Sugar — in the form of lactose — contributes about 55 percent of skim milk’s calories, giving it ounce for ounce the same calorie load as soda.

I remember reading (can&#8217;t remember where) how humans are the only animals that have adapted to continue to drink milk after their adolescence.
