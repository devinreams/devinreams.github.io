I love the internet. I've grown up with it. Even as a kid I remember being addicted to it. In fact, I sometimes forget how things got done before it was around. I can't imagine what it was like to register for classes with a pencil and paper. It's scary how much we rely on technology...

	But what's more scary are those evil things going on. Of course, we all hear about the MySpace meetups where 16 year olds run off to meet their 40-year old cyber lovers. But what about those that keep their lives in the virtual world? That supposed harmless haven?

	Have you heard of <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>? Odds are you have. People say this online virtual world is changing the way people interact. With over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">6 million</a> people conducting every-day transactions, lectures, and all-hands meetings it appears to be a pretty big deal.

	But wait, it gets better. Now people are talking about <strong>virtual rape</strong>. <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/commentary/sexdrive/2007/05/sexdrive_0504">Wired reports</a> and <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/05/09/de-incentivizing-virtual-rape/">Melissa has more</a>.

	Go read the articles and let that sink in a minute.

	It may or may not be a crime. That's certainly up for debate. But the fact we've moved online, used it efficiently, then this? Why did this have to come along for the ride?

	Have I mentioned... it's virtual? Does this scare you? It scares the hell out of me...
