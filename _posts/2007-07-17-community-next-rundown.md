I had a blast last weekend in San Francisco. My buddy Noah (and Adam) hosted the second Community Next conference. Luckily I was invited. I&#8217;ve put some [photos online][1] and my quick thoughts are found below.

## VIP Dinner

Friday was the VIP Dinner. I chatted with a bunch of awesome guys including the CTO of [Pandora][2] Tom Conrad, [Shel Israel][3], Eric from [icanhascheezburger][4], the [MyBlogLog][5] team, the [Scrapblog][6] team, [Dave McClure][7], [Andrew Chen][8], and so on.

## Pre-Party

Then we hit the pre-party at Old Pro (in Palo Alto). It was a ton of fun (and sponsored by [Yahoo!][9] again). I hung out with great folks including the aforementioned plus [Poornima][10] from [Mint][11], Shivani from [Women2.0][12], Gabe from [Techmeme][13], and so on and so forth. I was humbled all evening. I also had the pleasure of hanging out with Andre Nosalsky, [Scott Hurff][14] and [Rob Johnson][15]. They happened to be my roommates for the evening. Thats a story in and of itself.

## The Conference

The next morning the conference was at the [PlugandPlayTechCenter][16] which was an excellent spot for the conference. It went by a lot faster than the last one. Perhaps that&#8217;s because I could actually sit and enjoy it. Which I did. I heard some cool people speak about an awesome area right now: viral marketing. We heard from employee number four at MySpace, icanhascheezburger, hi5, Pownce, Justin.tv, Crazy Egg, Timothy Ferriss, and so on. A lot of Facebook discussion and plenty on what you should and should not do to attract and retain users.

## Bottom Line

Another great conference. I enjoyed chatting with everyone there and am still excited by the caliber of the attendees. Like I said, I was lucky to be there. The Community Next conferences have been phenomenal and I look forward to the future (yes, there will be more!).
