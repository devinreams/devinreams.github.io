Not a morning person? That&#8217;s fine, most people aren&#8217;t. Though, have you ever noticed that some of the most productive (and successful) people you know are early-risers? Sure, there are exceptions to this rule but in general, those that get up early use those first few hours to get their day started the right way.

So what&#8217;s the point of getting up early? It&#8217;s simple, really&#8230;

## Mornings are distraction-less

I remember an article in [FastCompany][1] (can&#8217;t find it, though) that outlined a number of executives&#8217; daily routines. Each of them were waking up early and taking care of things before the day got hectic:

*   Working out
*   Eating a healthy breakfast
*   Catching up on email
*   Reading and watching the morning news
*   etc&#8230;

By waking up at 6, 5, or even 4am they were able to hit the day running without interruption. That&#8217;s the key to productivity: removing the distractions. Waking up early does that for you.

## You get a head-start on everyone

An obvious benefit to getting up early is the fact you&#8217;re up and starting your day before everyone else. By the time they get into the office they&#8217;ve already got your email in their inbox, you&#8217;ve already had your cup of coffee and are ready start producing results.

## You can&#8217;t put things off

Waking up early means you&#8217;ve accomplished things that may have been scheduled later. For example, I used to budget time in the evening to go to the gym. I realized that things always come up in the evening. It&#8217;s too easy to put things off later in the day. If you do them in the morning before distractions and interruptions can occur, you&#8217;re bound to always get them done.

## My experiences

Now that you understand some of the benefits of getting up early I&#8217;ll describe my routine:

*   6:00am &#8211; Wake up and go to gym
*   7:00am &#8211; Return home, make breakfast, read WSJ
*   7:45am &#8211; Shower, get dressed
*   8:00am &#8211; Either go to work (2 days) or read before school (2 days)

It&#8217;s a simple schedule but it&#8217;s dramatically changed things for me. First, I&#8217;m actually going to the gym as often as I&#8217;d like to. As soon as I wake up I put on my shoes and head out the door. No excuses, no delay, it just happens. After working out, a few minutes in the jacuzzi mean I can collect my thoughts before the day starts. I already have a mental plan by 7am.

Second, I eat a good breakfast every morning. I rarely ate breakfast in the past but now it&#8217;s a simple gesture every morning. While I&#8217;m eating I also read the paper and enjoy some silence as the sun comes up.

Third, I&#8217;m not rushed in the morning. I always have time to collect my thoughts. I never forget to bring anything to school. I never go out the door without some snack packed for the day. By waking up early and having more time I essentially slow down my morning.

## What do you do?

If I haven&#8217;t convinced you yet, try getting up early every day for a week. As it becomes a habit it becomes easier. It&#8217;s obviously a great way to be productive and start your day right. But, I&#8217;m curious, what&#8217;s your morning routine?
