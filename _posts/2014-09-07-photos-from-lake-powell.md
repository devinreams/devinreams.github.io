As the summer started to come to an end, a group of us took advantage of a deal to rent a houseboat at Lake Powell for a few days.

We left in the afternoon on a Thursday, drove almost all the way to the Bullfrog Marina in Utah, spent the night in a motel, and then woke up early on Friday and checked out our boats.

We set out with no particular plan in mind on Friday. After taking a break to swim, we looked for a place to park the boat off in a canyon. From there we could take the motorboat out to do some tubing, fishing, and sight seeing.

We enjoyed afternoons of relaxing in floating rafts, enjoying some beverages, sliding off the slide, and soaking in some sun.

It was a nice "off the grid" weekend and great scenery as always (this was my third trip to Lake Powell). Be sure to Check out [my photos from Lake Powell](http://photos.devin.reams.me/lake-powell) over at [Exposure](https://exposure.co/).
