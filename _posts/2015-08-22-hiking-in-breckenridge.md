It had been a while since Rachel and I visited Breckenridge. Since we were in Maine for the winter we didn't spend any time in the mountains (of Colorado) skiing.

So, when we had a chance to take a long weekend up to Breck and do some hiking we took it! Our friends brought us on an awesome hike up to Mohawk Lake. The mining history and natural beauty in Summit County never gets old.
