Ever since SXSW I&#8217;ve rethought a lot of what it is I&#8217;m doing, what my priorities are, etc. I&#8217;ve also noticed that every night I get home from work and I&#8217;m tired. Crazy huh? I also get hungry at lunch time.

But seriously, I hate getting home and not feeling motivated to do anything else. So, I&#8217;ve gone back to something I perfected in college: [napping][1].

At the time, biphasic and polyphasic sleep were being (re)discovered online. I stopped taking naps after I started my big-boy job out of college. But now, I realize, it&#8217;d be great to take a nap and start a &#8216;second day&#8217; every night.

So my schedule is as follows:

*   08:00 AM &#8211; Wake up, go to work, etc.
*   06:00 PM &#8211; Leave work, have dinner, etc.
*   08:00 PM &#8211; Sleep
*   11:00 PM &#8211; Wake up, start &#8216;second day&#8217; (read, watch movies, blog, etc.)
*   05:00 AM &#8211; Go to sleep

My body is, luckily, still used to the 80-90 minute sleep cycles so I can get away with two chunks of 3 hours and feel energized all day.

Two days in and I&#8217;ve hit the ground running. I&#8217;m pretty stoked. If you have any questions and want to try biphasic sleep / naps just leave a comment.
