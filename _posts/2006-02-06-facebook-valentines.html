<img align="right" id="image91" alt="valentine.png" src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/valentine.png" />Yes, Facebook is offering '<a href="http://okdork.com/2006/02/06/facebook-feature-proclaim-your-valentines-day-love/">Facebook Valentines</a>'. Cute idea, but there are some problems. Don't get me wrong, I love Facebook and everything those <a href="http://www.avalonstar.com/">hard</a> <a href="http://okdork.com/">working</a> individuals produce... I guess they've spoiled me: I expect the absolute best.

First, the annoucement box is not pink! Sure the text is red but it really should stand out a bit more. Second, the picture shown to the right is obviously not zooming in on a Facebook Valentine. Lazy lazy... Third, I can't wait to see the <em>"Hey Jon, your Mom isn't on Facebook so would you mind telling her 'thanks' for me?"</em> Valentine. Ehh, is it worth the $5? I wish Facebook would provide more statistics on Annoucements (number shown, number of impressions/clicks, etc). That'd be neat.
