<p>I'm not quite sure I follow <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2018972097_microsoftlogo23.html">what happened here</a>, but I think I get it:</p>

<p>The Windows logo is no longer a flag, it's a window (twisted to an angle) with added prominence to the word mark. It no longer incorporates the multi-color, signature style of Windows and has becomes a single color.</p>

<p>The Microsoft logo, for the company that sells the Windows product, is no longer a plain word mark but has a symbol. The symbol incorporates the four colors from the Windows flag, and the straight-on look of a four-pane window.</p>

<p>If it wasn't clear before: Microsoft is Windows, and Windows is Microsoft. This is not a new Microsoft, nothing is changing, in fact, they're only becoming more locked in to the status quo.</p>

<p>Why, contrary to traditional marketing, is the product marketing and the overall company marketing now so intertwined? Microsoft is further limiting their ability to market new products unless its Windows-centric (mobile, desktop, tablet, internet, etc.). I fully expect the Xbox to be renamed Windows Game Box.</p>
