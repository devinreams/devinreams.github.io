Now that I have a few spare minutes to collect my thoughts I figured I&#8217;d share a little about my professional life as of late:

## The Previous Employer

If you&#8217;re not aware, I left my job of 11 months and 3 weeks (just barely a year) this past July 18th. I had been working at E&Y and made a quick decision to move on to my passion: the internet. The firm itself is awesome; they&#8217;ve definitely earned the many awards and recognitions (a top 25 employer for a decade according to [Fortune][2]). I learned a lot, worked with great people and clients, and I don&#8217;t really regret anything about my time spent at E&Y.

### Lessons learned from my first full-time job out of college:

[<img style="float:left; padding-right: 5px" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1288/1350774613_09ec0c2d32_m.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="240" />][3]I&#8217;ve learned plenty from my other experiences and jobs but this one is a bit different. It was my first full-time job out of college (not an internship, not a part-time job); one where I had bosses, business cards, a phone number, responsibilities, performance reviews, etc. Some things may be obvious or things you&#8217;ve read about before&#8211;but this is the kind of stuff I finally learned from experience.

*   You&#8217;ll never love everything about any job. But it&#8217;s definitely possible to dislike most of it.
*   The people you work with are extremely important (50 hours is different than a few times a week).
*   Hopefully you like those people if you don&#8217;t like the work, or else things get frustrating.
*   Despite management&#8217;s best attempts, I&#8217;m still convinced I can work an entry-level corporate job from home.
*   And I could probably do a typical entry-level corporate job in 20 hours a week.
*   Many people still see the &#8216;ladder&#8217; and the need to &#8216;pay dues&#8217;, they&#8217;re the rule, not the exception
*   Some people are very good at getting work done, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they can manage / lead
*   Big companies are great because there are processes and structure that help support you
*   The wealth of knowledge is &#8220;out there&#8221; but so damned hard to collect and organize
*   Traveling can be fun no matter where you go (anywhere from Lexington to Atlanta)

&#8230;and I could go on and on.

    The Current Employer
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;m now working for <a href="http://www.crowdfavorite.com/">Crowd Favorite</a> which is an internet company specializing in WordPress (the software that powers this website), custom web development and design, consulting, and builds some web products. Surprise surprise, I&#8217;m working on the web!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I suppose this isn&#8217;t new: I&#8217;ve moved around a lot and some people might look at that as being scattered or unfocused. But, guess what: all that moving around and dabbling paid off! I found something I really enjoy (and I think I&#8217;m good at it, too). How do I know? For starters, I&#8217;ve been excited to go to work all 10 days these last two weeks (and enjoy checking / responding to business e-mails during some of my spare time)!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My job is a mixture of things but I think we could describe it as a mix of the following:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Account management:</strong> working closely with customers to help address things including future development needs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Business development:</strong> following up with individuals that are looking to use our services, deciding what we can do to help and make sure they&#8217;ve fully explored their projects
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Project management:</strong> managing project goals and tasks, scheduling them internally, managing budgets, updates to clients, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Internal projects:</strong> there are some things we&#8217;d like to do internally and I&#8217;ll be managing those, too
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    So, that sums up what I&#8217;ve been doing and what I&#8217;ll be working on. Everyone I work with is great, I&#8217;m happy, excited and learning plenty each and every day.
