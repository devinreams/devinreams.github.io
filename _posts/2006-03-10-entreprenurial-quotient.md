What&#8217;s your [Entreprenurial Quotient][1]? I got a 72%. I&#8217;m okay with that because a few of the questions ask what are the &#8216;best&#8217; and, well, I get to pick what&#8217;s &#8216;best&#8217; right? But seriously, they&#8217;re some good questions. Oh, and why make us go through the Tickle sign up? If I can make a [FIRO-B assessment][2] you can put together a quiz that doesn&#8217;t require my birthdate!
