Well, have you heard of the &#8220;Tebow&#8221;ne shot? I hadn&#8217;t either until the other night when we visited a local pub here in Denver (specializing in meats), [Euclid Hall][1], with some friends.

Since Tebow&#8217;s signature move is ripe for emulating and very topical (all the cool kids are doing it), here&#8217;s a little bar trick to teach your friends:

*   place an order for a &#8220;shot&#8221; of your choosing
*   finish off your tasty bone marrow appetizer, save the bone
*   get down on one knee with the bone and the shot
*   tilt head back, open mouth
*   pour said shot down aforementioned bone into mouth

There you have it, the &#8220;Tebow&#8221;ne (get it? T-bone!) shot. If anything, it&#8217;s fun to describe to people, but even more entertaining if you&#8217;re looking for some attention&#8230;
