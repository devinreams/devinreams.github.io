If you didn't know, my nickname is 'Dreams'. Try and decode that one. Anyway, this past week I learned, did, and found a lot of cool things. Check it out:

<strong>Monday</strong>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/2505310391/"><strong>Dopplr added a carbon journal</strong></a> for travelers to realize how much they're destroying the planet. Hooray!

<strong>Tuesday</strong>
I found a nice little Mac app which I've been looking for since, oh, I owned a MacBook. It's called <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/blog/2008/05/15/i-love-stars"><strong>I Love Stars</strong></a> and allows you to rate your iTunes songs from the menu bar.

<strong>Wednesday</strong>
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ICanHasCheezburger/~3/287115426/"><strong>Communist parties</strong></a> are funny when cats are involved.

<strong>Thursday</strong>
It was a big week for sports for me. I visited the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/2488598666/"><strong>Twins in Minneapolis</strong></a>. Saw them play the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/2501204750/
"><strong>Rockies in Denver</strong></a>. Oh, and I went to a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/2506159578/"><strong>soccer game</strong></a> (Colorado vs. Salt Lake).

<strong>Friday</strong>
I bought <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/devdev/2457072625/"><strong>tickets to Colombia</strong></a>. It's going to be an interesting experience and you know I'll share my thoughts here.

If you haven't already added me as a contact on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/"><strong>Flickr</strong></a>--be sure to do so. Oh, and <a href="http://twitter.com/devinreams
"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>, too.
