Here&#8217;s [Ethan Kaplan][1], a smart developer slash executive, and his take on &#8220;culture&#8221;:

> Too often, the things that constitute “culture” are seen as additive or “perks.” I hate defining things as “perks” because it relegates them to things that should be seen as optional if and when times get tough. Similarly, in recruitment, “perks” mean “these are not core, but are additive in order to be attractive.” I’ve found perks are always the first things to go as cultural efforts in a company’s decline. And more damaging still, perks aren’t an element of culture. They are frosting on a thin cake.

The argument to build culture like a product makes good sense in a product or development-centric environment. This was a good read&#8230;
