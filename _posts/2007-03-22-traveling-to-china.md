I think the biggest piece of advice anyone out of college would give is to travel while you&#8217;re young (and in college). I&#8217;ve heard it a number of times. From friends, family, family friends, professors, etc. Having seen my friends study abroad for months at a time and knowing that my elders are wiser than I, I&#8217;ve realized that it&#8217;s time for me to travel. So, I&#8217;m going to China&#8230;

<!--more-->

I&#8217;ve been out of the country a few times. Twice to New Zealand and a number of times to Canada. It had been a while since I&#8217;d traveled though so here&#8217;s my first lesson before I even left:

## Passports take many weeks to be renewed

Mom constantly reminded me and I constantly put if off. I then realized I needed my passport back in less than a month and the processing can take up to 8 weeks. Oops. That mistake cost me a few extra bucks to have it expedited.

## You can&#8217;t *really* do your own photo

The guidelines for passport photos are all online and very easy to follow. But, little did I know, this is really just a joke. You can&#8217;t take your own passport photos. They laugh at whatever you bring in. I printed the right size, perfect quality, but nope&#8230; don&#8217;t bother. Pay the extra $15 at the Post Office to get it done.

## You have to be *invited* to China

I knew that you had to have permission (and good reason) to move to India but I didn&#8217;t realize you needed an invitation to visit China. I&#8217;ll be traveling with a tour group so that was obviously taken care of. In any case, I didn&#8217;t realize a Visa was needed to visit China.

## Credit cards don&#8217;t work in China

I can leave the Visa, MasterCard and AmEx at home. Despite what the commercials say, these guys are *not* accepted everywhere. Lots of Traveler&#8217;s Checks are to be purchased today. As they say, Cash is king.

So, any last minute advice, tips, anything? I get on the plane early tomorrow morning and I plan to return with great pictures, stories and lessons. Of course, I&#8217;ll share them all. See you in April&#8230;
