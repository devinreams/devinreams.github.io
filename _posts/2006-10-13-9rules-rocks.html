I had some free time today. Instead of a music video I did my own rap song in GarageBand. This song is dedicated to all those cool kids at 9rules. Enjoy.

<blockquote>
Let me tell you 'bout a site, it's got lots of blogs
It's older than you think, but not as much as pogs
Yeah, pogs, I can't rhyme
The CD's name? <a href="http://www.pingsix.com/">White comma Tyme</a>.

<em>Scrivs: Hi Tyme, Tyme: I'm sorry?</em>

It came about in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030922223536/http://www.9rules.com/">oh three</a>, it looked wicked lame
It needed some design, so in <a href="http://www.businesslogs.com/">Mike</a> came

<em>Mike: What does it taste like?</em>

The CEO's a dork, he danced like a fool
I <a href="http://9rules.com/en/browse/featured/archive/154/">challenged him</a> because he looked so damn cool
His name's Scrivs, S-C-R-I-V
He's bringing sexy back just like JT

<em>Tyme: Don't you realize that? Laughing. Scrivs: What?</em>

They go and look at the coolest blogs for us
Just like Justin I'll take it to the chorus

<em>9rules rocks, 9rules rules</em>

Those members kick ass, I've met a lot
You guys know <a href="http://www.madeincr.com/">josue</a>, he smokes tons of pot
People like <a href="http://www.paulstamatiou.com/">Stammy</a> look at <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/">Mint</a> non-stop
Their heads are so big they're about to pop

Just playing, you guys are the shit
You're the best blog network, err content network, no community
Thats it!

<em>9rules rocks, 9rules rules</em>

If you dont have a <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Mac</a> you cant get in
How'd Tyme get hired? Her <a href="http://devinreams.com/etc/tymeface.jpg">purple-faced grin</a>?

<em>Tyme: Devin needs his ass spanked. Scrivs: You're fucked.</em>

But seriously, I love these guys
their sites are the best, they're wicked flys!

<em>Tyme: They're doing something cool, Scrivs</em>

They are, you know how we do
9rules, it rocks people
Let it be known
Back to the chorus

<em>9rules rocks, 9rules rules</em>

Shit, I'm not even a member.
