I really despise our public school systems. For someone as un-smart as myself I've figured out how to "beat" them... that says a lot. Oh, and (as mentioned in Paul Graham's article) <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">our schools act more like prisons</a>. Oh, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/education/26child.html?ex=1301029200&en=0c91b5bd32dabe2a&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">now we're only going to teach the few things fom the national tests</a>. Oh, and I can go on all night. Excuse the blunt remark but as far as education (and remaining competitive) is concerned: the U.S. is <strong>fucked</strong>.
