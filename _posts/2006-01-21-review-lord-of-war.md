<img width="64" height="96" align="right" id="image52" alt="lordofwar.jpg" src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/lordofwar.jpg" /> I&#8217;ll be brief, this movie was great. Nicholas Cage&#8217;s character, Yuri, is *the* Lord of War. He rubs shoulders with the worst people in the world and supplies them with, as he puts it, a means to defend themselves. This movie exposes you to the most fascinating &#8230; facts or fiction? &#8230; of arms dealing. I believe theres many truths to it, and the drama itself is very interesting.

There were a number of memorable quotes from the movie that I&#8217;d like to share:

> &#8220;Governments are changed more often by bullets than votes.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;After the Cold War, the AK-47 became Russia&#8217;s biggest export. After that came vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists.&#8221;

I could go on but the movie is certainly worth watching. There&#8217;s a touch of humor *and* history, how could you not like it? It&#8217;s harsh, though. Reality sometimes is. You&#8217;ll see bloodshed; much of it is actually occuring as you read this (all seven of you).

If I were to give this a rating I&#8217;d say 9/10. IMDB users rated it a 7.5 (which is high). Did anyone else like it as much as I did? Maybe I found it favorable becuase it gave me a chance to test out my new electric blanket&#8230;
