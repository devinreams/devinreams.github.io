It appears as if Melody is onto something: [aspartame is dangerous][1]&#8230; and it&#8217;s in every pack of gum in my house! I, honest to goodness, wondered why sometimes I felt weird when I chewed a lot of gum (Orbit is my weapon of choice) in a day. I don&#8217;t think I can quit all together but I&#8217;ll certainly ween myself off it (I chew half pieces anyway).
