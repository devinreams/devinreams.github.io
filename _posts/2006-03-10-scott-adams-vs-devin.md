Scott Adams, yesterday: &#8220;I was taking a shower one day ? that?s where all my good ideas are born&#8230;&#8221; vs Devin Reams, 3 weeks ago: &#8220;I was doing some quality thinking in the shower (my best ideas originate while soaking in hot water)&#8221;. I thought I was the only crazy shower thinker.
