Want your name in lights on the new &#8220;Credits&#8221; page in \[WordPress 3.2\](http://wordpress.org/news/2011/06/wordpress-3-2-release-candidate/)? This page shows up in all WordPress.org blog dashboards (but interestingly enough, not on WordPress.com). If you use WordPress every day it&#8217;s pretty easy to get involved testing, filing bugs, and submitting patches on \[Trac\](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/). I found two small bugs in the new Twenty Eleven theme in about 30 minutes and submitted patches in just as little time.
