I&#8217;m a huge fan of Google, it&#8217;s no secret. I finally found the opportunity to play with an [Android][1] device. I&#8217;ve used a first-generation iPhone exclusively since March 2008. I like [change][2] so I&#8217;ve taken a [HTC Dream][3] for a spin (using [Cupcake 1.5][4]) for the last two days.

I have a few quick observations that may or may not have been covered elsewhere:

&nbsp;

*   **<span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>The hardware is awful:</strong>&nbsp;I don&#8217;t know why phone developers are so terrible. They have been for years. Apple shook up the scene with a top-of-the-line expensive device and now it&#8217;s mainstream. It&#8217;s been over a year, why does everything still fall short (design, speed)? Just copy everything and at least pretend like you&#8217;re trying.</span>**
*   **The software is awesome:** I&#8217;m jumping into the game mid-stride with Android so what I saw out-of-the-box is very impressive (push notifications, background processes, video recording, etc.). But it&#8217;s arguably right on-par with Apple at this stage. Things like the notifications bar (I can see I got an email and text message and missed a call) and widgets (I can see the weather or the score of the Rockies game on the home screen) are like a breath of fresh-air coming from the very tunnel-visioned iPhone.
*   **Slow slow slow:**&nbsp;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the device, the software, or some mixture of both but it seems memory and speed are lacking. I&#8217;ll sit and wait for 5 seconds at a time just to watch an application pop open. Perhaps the background processes need a way that help the user protect them from themselves (yeah, I should open up 10 things at once, sure).
*   **Awkward clicking instead of tapping:**&nbsp;as of the writing, no pinch to zoom makes weird zoom levels that require a lot more tapping than a simple pinch would. This is software and hopefully Google will decide it&#8217;s worth sticking it in. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind, not all Android devices will have touch screens (televisions?) so it&#8217;s understandable.
*   **The browser is hard for users:**&nbsp;zooming, changing windows, opening bookmarks: all things I do often and require at least two-too-many clicks.
*   **<span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Application offerings are so-so:</strong>&nbsp;I&#8217;ve found a lot of great applications (tools, games, widgets) and I&#8217;m really impressed with what&#8217;s out there. There is a lot to be desired and lots of empty space to fill. Now is probably a good time to become a big player in a growing space.</span>**
*   **No good media sync off-the-shelf:**&nbsp;you have an SD card (awesome, removable storage!) but you lack the ability to sync with something like iTunes. You are forced back to the drag-dropping of files onto a drive. But if you don&#8217;t use this as a media device, no worries
*   **The applications are as bad as the developer makes them:** a huge criticism is the lack of polish on Android phones and in the applications. Sure, Apple hands you everything you need with their SDK, thus, you get a lot of nice UI elements for free. But, you get stuck with a closed system, an application &#8220;review&#8221; process, and a bunch of hoops. Android says &#8216;do what you want&#8217;. Think Facebook and MySpace: that profile page on MySpace looks only as bad as someone chose to make it.
*   **More buttons means more depth:** a lot of people look at the iPhone/iPod touch and see two buttons: &#8216;power&#8217; and &#8216;home&#8217;. Though it may seem cluttered, the additional buttons on most Android devices (&#8216;menu&#8217;, &#8216;back&#8217;, &#8216;home&#8217;, scroll ball, etc.) means more application depth. I can quickly scroll around a list with the ball. I can click and hold the ball (or my finger) to bring up more actions. Each screen can respond to a &#8216;menu&#8217; button which allows you to stick things like &#8220;Settings&#8221; and &#8220;Refresh&#8221; somewhere where the user isn&#8217;t always faced with it.
*   **Virtual keyboard and touch-screen is so-so:** the original Android device only offered a keyboard (arguably much nicer to type on, I forgot about mobile keyboards! The tactile response virtual (on screen) keyboard is nice but the overall size seems small and tight. Oh, and the way I use my thumb on Android seems to &#8216;hit&#8217; right below where I always intend to. Apple must do some calculating to shift those touches upward. (Put your thumb against a flat surface, the curvature means the top usually hits first and is immediately recorded as opposed to the overall footprint of the finger)..
*   **<span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Integration with Google Voice is nearly perfect:</strong>&nbsp;it&#8217;s not seamless, but close enough. I can send text messages from either my cell or my Google Voice number. I can set my calls to do the same. Maybe this way I&#8217;ll get everyone &#8216;switched&#8217; over to my new, preferred number.</span>**
*   **Additional Google integration:** I don&#8217;t even know where I would to go change which Google Account is associated with the device. All I know is my calendar, contacts, and GMail are all there. No settings page, no picking ports.

&nbsp;

As of right now, with a mix between the hardware offerings and software, I&#8217;d give the overall experience a 7/10 (iPhone is an 8, Blackberry Pearl is a 5).

It wouldn&#8217;t take that much to knock Apple off it&#8217;s throne; in fact, it&#8217;d be better for everyone. I&#8217;m rooting for Android but likely sticking to Apple. We&#8217;ll see if the costs outweigh the benefits in the next few days.
