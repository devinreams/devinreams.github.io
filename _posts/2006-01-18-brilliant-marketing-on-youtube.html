What's the fourth most watched video on YouTube? It's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/w/Ronaldinho%3A--Touch-of-Gold?v=aRHk8ol0vTw&feature=Views&page=1&t=a&f=b">this one</a>.Who posted it? Some cool dude named 'Nikesoccer'. Um, looks like someone is ahead of the curve. Someone "gets it". Oh, and most clicks are from myspace.
