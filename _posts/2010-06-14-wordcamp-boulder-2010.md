As with last year\[^1], [Crowd Favorite\](http://crowdfavorite.com/) will be hosting and organizing the local \[WordCamp conference for the Denver/Boulder area\](http://2010.boulder.wordcamp.org). If you don&#8217;t know, WordCamp is a WordPress conference for people of various backgrounds and interests (it&#8217;s like no other conference I can think of). I&#8217;m excited to see how our \[Hydeified\](http://andrewhy.de) approach works out this year. We&#8217;re always open to suggestions and ideas, feel free to reach out.

\[^1]: I organized WordCamp Denver 2009 at the Denver Art Museum. I wrote a [recap\](https://devin.reams.me/wordcamp-denver-2009-organizer-recap/) here.
