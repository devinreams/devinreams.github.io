I had the privilege of visiting Tokyo :japan: last week. The week before the [GitHub Kaigi conference](http://githubkaigi.org/), @dsorkin, @dice and I visited with GitHub customers in the Tokyo area to gather feedback, answer questions, and share some future plans. In addition to the conference and meetings, we co-hosted a meetup on Wednesday and another on Friday.

I've shared [some photos](http://photos.devin.reams.me/visiting-tokyo) highlighting a few themes from the trip: the city, its lights, and its food.

I also created a ["top picks" list on foursquare](https://foursquare.com/devinreams/list/top-picks-near-shibuya-in-tokyo) and a quick [video showing how Genki Sushi works](https://vimeo.com/97013288).
