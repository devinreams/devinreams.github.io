<strong>Quote of the Day:</strong>
<blockquote><strong></strong> It's really scary to quit your job at an average company doing average work just because you know that if you stay, you'll end up just like them.

Which is why it's such a great opportunity.</blockquote>

<em>Note to self: Become more observant. Am I working at an average company?</em>
