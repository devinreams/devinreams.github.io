<a href="http://careerintensity.com/blog/2006/01/30/soft-skills/">Dave</a> points to a great article from Fortune on soft skills: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/02/06/8367928/index.htm">The war for top executive talent</a>. The consulting group I work for actually provides classroom based soft-skill training to large (Fortune 500) companies. Interesting quote: <em>"Ask your company's best leaders to name the most powerful learning experiences they've had." They will hardly ever mention a class and will almost always name a real-life experience in business. The challenge is to find ways to replicate those experiences."</em>
