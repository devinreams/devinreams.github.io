I&#8217;d like to introduce you all to The Shoddy Site Of the Day: [Breckenridge.Snow.Com][1]. Overall the site is pretty nice. Very informative. I popped online last night to figure out the conditions for today. I can find everything I need on this site&#8230;

Except a useful map.

Seriously, at a ski resort, your product is the mountain. Why do you force me to look at what you&#8217;d like to call a &#8216;[new interactive trail map][2]&#8216;. People are not so dumb that they need a drop down to show them what a trail is. I&#8217;d guess its all that space inbetween the green tree-looking stuff. I wish I knew what that stuff was&#8230; but it&#8217;s not labeled on the interactive trail map. Sigh&#8230;

Seriously, I have to look at this thing first to then realize what I *really* came for is a little link at the top of this window.

You be the judge: [stupid, useless, busy, and animated map][2] or [practical, even printable, trail map][3].

This is a classic designer&#8217;s case of &#8216;I can do it so I really should&#8217;. I find none of this to be useful. If I want to find the black trails, I look for the&#8230; black colored trails? Honestly. Look at the compass in the bottom corner. If you hover over it the compass blurs.

What the hell? Why? It does me no good to see a blurred compass!

&#8220;Hey Mark, look, its called &#8216;onmouseover&#8217;, I should really make it do something!&#8221; &#8220;Yeah man, since you *can* you really *should*.&#8221;

&#8230;and that is why I call this my Shoddy Site of the Day.
