NBC sucks. The worst thing they could have done is [send YouTube a C&#038;D letter][1]. Viral marketing can be defined as:* Marketing phenomenon that facilitates and **encourages** people to pass along a marketing message*. Without that marketing it wouldn&#8217;t have become popular. Which meant it wouldn&#8217;t be on iTunes. Does anyone else realize** the material from <span class="rss:item">Lonely Island (the guys who came up with it) was created under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons</a> license</span>**<span class="rss:item">? I thought that was what made them so neat in the first place. NBC, you used to be cool&#8230;</span>
