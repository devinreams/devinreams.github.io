	While I'm nearly through with finals I've not quite crossed the finish line yet. This means there's been a lot of studying lately. For many that means a lot less sleep. Well, if you're like me and still working 15 hours a week you'll probably wonder how you can get away with sleeping at work.

	I couldn't help but pass this along (thanks, Aunt Shiela). We'll see how well it works tomorrow. With that said, here it it:

	<h2>Top Five Things To Say After Caught Sleeping At Your Desk</h2>

	<ol>
	<li>They told me at the Blood Bank this might happen.</li>
	<li>This is just a 15 minute power nap they raved about in the time management course you sent me to.</li>
	<li>Whew!  Guess I left the top off the Whiteout. You probably got here just in time.</li>
	<li>Did you ever notice sound coming out of these keyboards when you put your ear down real close?</li>
	<li>Raise your head slowly and say, "...in Jesus' name, Amen."</li>
	</ol>

	Keep on keeping on, everyone... I'm off to study.
