I had the privledge of touching a [Kindle 2][1]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devinreamscom-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B00154JDAI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> at SXSW when [Alex][2] and I bumped into [Brian][3]. I learned one thing quickly: Kindle owners quickly turn into Kindle enthusiasts and evangelists.

The display is like nothing I&#8217;ve ever seen before. The screen doesn&#8217;t look digital, its almost like it was ink printed right on the device. Let me reinforce: this thing looks amazing! It&#8217;s almost as cool as a [Book][4] (comic, Penny Arcade).

But, nay, I mustn&#8217;t buy one *yet*. With over a dozen books on my [bookshelf][5] (the real ones, dead-tree books) I shall wait until I finish those before I buy up yet another gadget that may-or-may-not persuade me to do more of something (I&#8217;m looking at you Nike Plus).

*Update: I bought one! And the dead tree books are still on the shelf. :\*
