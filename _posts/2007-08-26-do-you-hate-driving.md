I hate driving&#8230; in rush hour traffic. I&#8217;ve toyed with leaving early, leaving late&#8211;to no avail. Unless you&#8217;re an hour and a half ahead of the pack you won&#8217;t get anywhere in Denver. My 50 mile drive turned into an 90 minute sit-and-stare fest. That&#8217;s one reason I just leased a new car.

[<img src='http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/untitled-2.png' alt='Nissan Sentra SL' style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />][1]I&#8217;ve been driving a Subaru station since the beginning of college (it&#8217;s a &#8217;94) and I figured, with my big-boy job and all, it was time I gave the family car back. I visited my local Nissan dealership, had my research and information all done and I was ready to commit. Two hours later I signed a two-year lease to a 2007 Nissan Sentra SL.

It&#8217;s pretty, it&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s new. I&#8217;m quite pleased. I don&#8217;t have to deal with the poor old Subaru&#8217;s clutch all day in traffic, I don&#8217;t have to wonder if my car will start this morning, I didn&#8217;t have to drop a ton of cash. I&#8217;m pleased with how things turned out. So, with all that said, I wish I didn&#8217;t have to drive; Denver is far too spread out.
