Just reading [this post][1] enrages me. Google isn&#8217;t ugly. It&#8217;s simple. Craigslist isn&#8217;t ugly, it&#8217;s content-rich. Purple backgrounds with yellow text on Myspace? That&#8217;s ugly. I will agree though, who cares what a blog looks like? You can&#8217;t see my pretty header in Bloglines. Blogs are about the content. Don&#8217;t judge a book by it&#8217;s cover&#8230; well, unless that book is Myspace. In that case you&#8217;d be right.
