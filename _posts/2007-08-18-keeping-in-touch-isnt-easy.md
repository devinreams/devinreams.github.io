Keeping in touch isn&#8217;t easy sometimes. These days with hundreds of Facebook, MySpace, and Linkedin friends it can be overwhelming and even paralyzing to try and be a good friend to everyone. I&#8217;m sure we all have our close groups of friends: the ones we go out with, call occasionally, see on the weekends. But what about everyone else? I have my own method of keeping in touch&#8230;

<img src='http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/man-cell.thumbnail.jpg' style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" /> Let me preface this by saying a methodological approach doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s any less meaningful. We can all agree, our lives are quick and busy. So, <span class="highlight">I force myself to reach out to at least three friends every day</span>. And, like most important things (schedule, to-do, contacts) I like to create a list or use a system to keep myself organized. So, I&#8217;ve created a spreadsheet that tracks the three people I&#8217;ve talked to and how we contacted each other (SMS, Phone, Facebook, etc.).

Sure, I could sit down every day and send a Facebook message to my friends but I&#8217;d start to see a pattern: I don&#8217;t call anyone, I don&#8217;t see anyone face-to-face. My hope is that <span class="highlight">hindsight will force me to be a better friend in the future</span>. There are so many people I want to keep up with, I&#8217;ve found this is a simple way to do that. And if you&#8217;re really lucky, your friends will want to reach out to you, too. I can&#8217;t wait for that day. ;)
