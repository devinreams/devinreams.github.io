I just wanted to post this article by Ramit because, well, <strong>I love it</strong>. It?s called <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2005/11/your_college_is.html">Your College is Not a Technical School</a>. I realize its a bit old but I re-read it today and whole-heartedly agree with everything it has to offer. In fact, it inspired me to add a few things to my <a href="http://devinreams.com/quotes/">quotes page</a>.
