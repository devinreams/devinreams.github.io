<p><strong>Elephant Not Interested in Using Treadmill</strong><br />
So far, it's the trainers at the Alaska Zoo who are breaking a sweat trying to coax Maggie the elephant onto the world's first treadmill for a pachyderm. (<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060517/ap_on_sc/elephant_treadmill">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Does the Alaskan Zoo have anything better to do? Does the Associated Press have anything better to do? Do <strong>I</strong> have anything better to do?</p>
