I found <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm">this to be extremely interesting</a>: an article about <strike>stupid</strike> students protesting the anti-immigration legislation. Flying the flag upside down, ironically, demonstrates <strong>distress</strong>... not disrespect. As another reader pointed out, it's also ironic that "...these young men and women are enjoying their educations on the back of the American taxpayer at a public school, while denigrating the country that provides these benefits to them." I guess that's fitting; our <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/03/26/education-sucks/">public schools don't teach</a> good sense. Sigh. One of my largest pet peeves has always been "people who make up for intelligence with volume." Yell louder when that's all you have going for you... Personally, I blame <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/03/28/french-strikes/">the French</a>.
