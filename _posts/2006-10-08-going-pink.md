While lots of people are changing [a few lines of CSS][1] I got up at 5:45am this morning to &#8216;Go Pink&#8217; and help out. Denver hosts the largest [Race for the Cure][2] in the nation and I lent a hand this morning.

This morning I was volunteering at the finish line handing out snacks to over 65,000 participants. It was intense, to say the least. Plus, I got to work with some neat Boy/Girl Scouts.

Overall, it was fun. If you don&#8217;t volunteer you should. Really.

&#8216;Nuff said.
