I like beer (we recently started homebrewing) and I like conventions. That&#8217;s precisely why I&#8217;m excited for my first [Great American Beer Festival][1] which is conveniently located here in Denver.

One pro-tip brought to our attention was to *bring food* to a half-day beer tasting convention. Sure, that makes sense. But what is the most convenient and tasty beer-related food you can bring<sup id="fnref-1479:1"><a href="#fn-1479:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>?

## Pretzel necklaces with a pencil

If you haven&#8217;t seen pretzel necklaces before, they&#8217;re simply a piece of string with hard pretzels, soft pretzels, funyons, and any other hole-based snack hanging from your neck. Think candy necklaces for adults.

You can make a bunch of them quickly if you **use an unsharpened pencil or pen to stack up a bunch of the pretzels** at once.

Just tape the string to the top of the pencil, slide the pretzels onto the pencil and viola. Now you don&#8217;t have to fumble with threading a flimsy string through a hole.

## Free business idea

I was able to make 3 necklaces this way in less than 5 minutes. I could likely sell one of these for a few bucks at the door while everyone is waiting.

In short, 36 necklaces per hour at $3 per necklace means over $100 for a quick hour of work.

    Some experts say these make you look &#8220;dumb&#8221; and may screw up your palate. We&#8217;ll see about that&#8230;&#160;<a href="#fnref-1479:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
