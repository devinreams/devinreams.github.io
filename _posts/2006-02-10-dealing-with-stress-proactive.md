When you look at stress in the long-run you&#8217;re no longer &#8216;dealing&#8217; with it but merely &#8216;managing&#8217; it. If you&#8217;re prepared to become stressed then you won&#8217;t be shocked when it hits. These are some thoughts I&#8217;ve compiled:

**Develop phyiscal resiliency:** Many sources suggest a healthy, controlled diet. Some things include eating less sugar, reducing caffeine consumption and avoiding alcohol. Personally, I don&#8217;t drink nor consume much caffeine so this could be one reason why I never become as stressed as my coffee-inhaling peers. Additionally, I&#8217;ve read a lot about eating a healthy variety of foods. Nutritionists often recommend the following:

*   5 or 6 servings of fruit and vegetables
*   4 servings of bread or cereal
*   2 servings of milk, cheese or yogurt; and
*   2 servings of protein such as meat, eggs and beans

This is a big area I could improve. I&#8217;ll be starting a personal journal to monitor my eating habits but in the meantime, [Askmen.com][1] has a list of the [top 10 stress reducing foods][2].

**Develop psychological resiliency:** The simplest way to overcome stress is to develop &#8216;hardiness&#8217; ([The Hardy Executive][3]). I&#8217;ve realized that I am a very &#8216;hardy&#8217; individual. For many, it&#8217;s easy to feel like they&#8217;re losing control. This may be due to any number of things (competitive drive, impatience, etc.) which often compose someone with an &#8216;A Personality&#8217;. The problem, though, is these things typically compound the problem. On the other hand, someone who&#8217;s hardy often approaches stressful situations optimistically. But, it&#8217;s not entirely clear what hardiness is. According to Developing Management Skills (Whetton) hardiness results from:

*   feeling in control of one&#8217;s life, rather than powerless to shape external events;
*   feeling committed to and involved in what one is doing, rather than alienated from one&#8217;s work and other individuals; and
*   feeling challenged by new experiences rather than viewing change as a threat to security and comfort.

This really isn&#8217;t that easy to accomplish but somehow it&#8217;s the mentality I&#8217;ve developed over the years. Perhaps just by considering the definition alone one can strive to achieve &#8216;hardiness&#8217;. I wish I knew, though&#8230;

I honestly feel my psychological resiliency sums up why I *never* become stressed. Would you tend to agree, [Shivani][4]? Hey, I&#8217;m starting to eat a bit better too, I bet that helps&#8230;
