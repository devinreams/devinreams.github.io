	It's nearly Thanksgiving and I've realized that perhaps I'm thankful for a bit more than my <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/11/20/being-thankful/">chair, monitors and slippers</a>. Perhaps life is a tad more than the physical objects we own. In fact, take away any and all possessions you have: what's left?

	<h2>My attitude</h2>
	I'm thankful for the attitude I've somehow acquired over the years. I constantly strive for optimism and rarely complain about my situation. Perhaps its ignorance or just plain stupidity but I can't get too upset with the hand I'm dealt. I'm thankful for that because I sometimes see people around me and, well, the stress is taking years from their lives.

	<h2>My intellect</h2>
	I've said it before, I'm not necessarily a smart guy. I'd argue I'm clever. I was somehow given an ability to look at certain things and simply understand them. I'm thankful for that and I realize I'd have to live my life quite differently if it weren't for that. I don't mean to sound conceited, I'm honestly lucky some things come a bit easier.

	<h2>The Internet</h2>
	I figure I'll go beyond the typical 'family, friends, and good health',  by also saying I'm thankful for the internet. Seriously. It's provided me with a number of experiences, stories, and learning opportunities. In addition, I've met a number of great people online. People across the country, on the other side of the world, and even within a half-day's drive of me. These people all come from different backgrounds and have so much to share. I find the internet to be invaluable. I think it's here to stay...

	<h2>A tasty meal</h2>
	In all honesty, I don't know why we celebrate Thanksgiving. I think it's a great excuse for eating and watching football, two of my more favorite things to do. I also figure it's a slick excuse to get lots of people to the stores. In any case, I'm thankful I'll have a nice big meal to go home to and a bit of time to relax.

	<strong>Happy Thanksgiving. Enjoy the time off and if you're going shopping on Friday, well, be careful out there.</strong>
