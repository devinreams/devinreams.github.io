**No. I will not fan you, your brand, or your blog.** I find it funny that quasi-famous bloggers feel the need to create a Facebook &#8216;Fan&#8217; page for themselves. Sure, many people are well-respected, followed by hundreds of thousands of individuals, and want to interact with them all ([Matt Mullenweg][1] and [Gary V][2]), but the majority of you do not; a few hundred or few thousand &#8216;fans&#8217; are worthless (prove me wrong?). [Jeff][3] may disagree, but I see no purpose in becoming a &#8216;fan&#8217; of a friend&#8217;s blog, or their brand, or their product, or whatever on Facebook. That only serves that individual&#8217;s own ego and their desire to grow some metric that rarely translates to value (monetary, goodwill, etc.). Social media: don&#8217;t just do it because everyone else is. <small>(I realize this is not new thinking, but I wanted to publish it so my stance is clear. Feel free to point your friends here when you get a &#8216;Fan&#8217; request.)</small>
