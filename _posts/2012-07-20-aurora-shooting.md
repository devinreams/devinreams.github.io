From Roger Ebert at [NYTimes.com][1]:

> The United States is one of few developed nations that accepts the notion of firearms in public hands. In theory, the citizenry needs to defend itself. Not a single person at the Aurora, Colo., theater shot back, but the theory will still be defended.

First: I&#8217;m moved and saddened by this event, it was a weird way to start the day for many of us I&#8217;m sure.

Will this be enough to start a real political debate? Not to be insensitive, especially so quickly after the fact, but I appreciate that [Bloomberg used this opportunity to say something][2] while Obama and Romney did not (beyond condolences, prayers). I&#8217;m curious if this is just going to remain a 24-hour-news story or can lead to a tipping point and begin change? I doubt it. I can&#8217;t think of any important gun-related legislation passed after Giffords (a Representative) was shot.

This is all very sad and certainly hits close to home. It&#8217;s just as sad how often shootings happen every day in cities across our country. I fear nothing will change.
