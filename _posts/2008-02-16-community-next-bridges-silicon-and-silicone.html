<a href="http://www.communitynext.com/">Community Next</a> is bridging Silicon Valley to the land of silicone with <strong>The Next Generation of Media and the Web</strong> happening Saturday, March 29 in West Hollywood. You may remember I've been pretty involved with Community Next and this one is going to be a neat twist on the original conferences: it's not in the Bay, it's in LA!

<strong>Quick overview:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learn how the web is changing and how to stay ahead of the curve</li>
<li>Connect with people from top online companies</li>
<li>Connect with funny/smart/cool/interesting people</li>
<li><strong>FREE OPEN BAR</strong> party, hosted by Twiistup on Friday night, March 28</li>
<li>FREE Redbull, food and drinks to keep you going at the conference</li>
</ul>

Speakers include Robert Scoble (scobleizer.com/Fast Company), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit, Founder), Veronica Belmont (Mahalo Daily) and more (<a href="http://communitynext.com/speakers">click here for full list of speakers</a>).
