MySpace is stupid as hell: "MySpace users who are 18 or over could no longer request to be on a 14- or 15-year-old's friends' list" (<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060621/ap_on_hi_te/myspace_online_safety">Link</a>). Oh yeah, all those creepy adults can only see partial profiles, now. Mission accomplished, guys. Are you kidding me?! On a website where people are aged 69, 123, 184, and 92 how the fuck was a users 'age' determined as the best deterrent? Go look at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/devinreams">my profile</a>, I'm suddenly a 14-year old in 30 seconds.
