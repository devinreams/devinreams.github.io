Are you a skiier/snowboarder in Colorado? If so, you should check out <a href="http://www.coloradosnowblog.com/">Colorado Snow</a> at <a href="http://www.coloradosnowblog.com">ColoradoSnowBlog.com</a>. It's my new hobby: to create the best online resource for Colorado snow sports. Let me know what you think and if you want to help out (post gear reviews, trail reviews, guides to resorts/trails/eating/playing just let me know).
