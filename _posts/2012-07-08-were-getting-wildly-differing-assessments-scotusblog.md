Here&#8217;s a fascinating [play-by-play from SCOTUSblog][1] of what happened in the media and at the White House (all within 15 minutes) after the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision being announced last week:

> The announcement of the Supreme Court’s decision largely upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Thursday, June 28 precipitated a genuine media drama.  Millions tuned in to get the result in real time, and were rewarded with the spectacle of two major news networks reporting the story incorrectly. Indeed, the President himself was in limbo while his staff raced to find out whether the Court had struck down his signature policy initiative.
