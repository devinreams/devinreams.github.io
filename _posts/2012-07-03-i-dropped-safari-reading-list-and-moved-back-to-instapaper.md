If you&#8217;ve ever looked at Safari&#8217;s new &#8220;Reading List&#8221; feature and wondered &#8220;is it good enough to replace [Instapaper][1]?&#8221; or a similar read-it-later service don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ve tested it out for you. Four months ago I moved all my articles into Safari (my primary web browser) and stopped using the Instapaper applications to read on my iPad and iPhone. Spoiler alert: I almost complete stopped saving articles to be read and I stopped reading saved articles.

Here are the big reasons I stopped using the Safari &#8220;Reading List&#8221;:

## 1. No home screen presence

Without a nagging reminder to keep reading when I pick up my phone during idle time, I default to spending my time in &#8220;less useful&#8221; ways such as checking Twitter, checking email, or playing a game. Without a dedicated application icon, for me it was hard to remember there is a list of good articles waiting for me buried in Safari (two or three taps away).

## 2. No API integration into apps (yet)

I find most of my long-form articles via Twitter and Reeder (RSS feeds). Both these applications have a dedicated button for sending a URL directly to Instapaper. There is no (currently) way to do this for the &#8220;Reading List&#8221; without taking two steps: open the link in Safari (which switches the currently open app) and then use the built-in Safari action to save to the Reading List (similar to &#8216;bookmarking&#8217;). This is slow and clumsy and led me to almost completely stop bookmarking articles to read later. Sometimes I would read it then and there just so I wouldn&#8217;t have to switch apps. Sometimes I would just skim the article and move on.

<small>(I can only presume future iOS versions will make this a simple action available to iOS apps.)</small>

## 3. No offline abilities

Instapaper does a great job turning an article into a simple, text-only version that will show up downloaded to my devices in the background. With Safari&#8217;s Reading List I need to be online to access the URL (tough luck if the URL goes offline temporarily or permanently) and then I need to use the &#8216;Reader&#8217; tab to see the text-only version. Again, this seems like extra steps and clumsy. It&#8217;s close, though.

<small>(I am aware that iOS 6 will add <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#safari">&#8220;Offline Reading&#8221; support</a>, that&#8217;s why this is number three.)</small>

* * *

Reading List has near parity to other read-it-later providers like Instapaper but it&#8217;s still a bit too fiddly to be useful. My guess is offline support will be good and a dedicated iOS &#8220;Save to Reading List&#8221; action is around the corner. I&#8217;ll try things out again and see if Instapaper drops off my home screen then. But, the point remains: without the nagging application on my home screen: I forget to read what I told myself I should.
