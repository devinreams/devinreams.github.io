Today <a href="http://www.okdork.com/">Noah</a> and I decided to launch <a href="http://www.yopos.com/">the yopos network</a> and I?m excited for the potential it has. The direction of the network is to be decided by our founding members but the two Noahs (<a href="http://www.okdork.com/">Kagan</a>/<a href="http://www.noahbrier.com/">Brier</a>) and I have some thoughts on what to do with it. Our intention is to essentialy create a group of smart and capable yopos (young professionals). We?ve invited a number of individuals and I?m looking forward to working with our members.But wait, what is our purpose? Well first, it?s to create relationships among yopos such as ourselves. Second, its to spotlight our members and their blogs. Finally, it?s to create an environment for collaboration. The Noahs and I, as I mentioned, have some great ideas and I look forward to seeing what we can do.

Anyway, we sent out our first wave of invites and are starting to receive confirmations back. Be sure to check out <a href="http://www.yopos.com/">yopos.com</a>, bookmark it, subscribe, do whatever, because we?re gonna be big?
