One of the best things you can do is spend a few hours cleaning, organizing and getting rid of crap. <span class="highlight">You may not think it&#8217;s there but it is.</span> I found four grocery bags worth of stuff yesterday and I couldn&#8217;t be happier&#8230;

Have you ever looked at something and said: &#8220;yeah, I might use that sometime&#8230;&#8221;? I said that a few times yesterday. I found myself keeping a lot of junk so I switched up the game: I took everything in my room on shelves, in drawers and under beds and put it out in the open.

## Why spend the time?

My room looked messy and stuff was everywhere but it was like working with a blank slate.

*   **I could group stuff together.** I didn&#8217;t really realize I had cables and gadgets in one drawer and other similar electronics in another. Similar stuff should go together!
*   **I could see what I really didn&#8217;t want.** If I had to physically put it back on a shelf <span class="highlight">it forced me to think twice</span> about it. Do I really need to hang onto that Pez dispenser? Do I need to save this old iPod box?
*   **I thought about last time I cleaned.** When I looked at each item I thought, &#8216;wow, I guess I didn&#8217;t use this since last time I cleaned&#8217;. That&#8217;s a good indicator that it&#8217;s not worth hanging onto that lanyard collection. I will never need to simultaneously carry 10 sets of keys on a long piece of fabric. Who knew?
*   **I found stuff I missed.** Pulling things out of boxes meant I could either a) empty that box and use it for something useful, or b) find cool stuff I forgot I had. I found all my Hawaii pictures yesterday. Good stuff!

## Was it worth it?

I sometimes think about all the &#8220;stuff&#8221; we have in our lives. Just like in *Fight Club*: <span class="highlight">&#8220;The things you own end up owning you&#8221;</span>. The simpler the better. An uncluttered room is less frustrating to look at and easier to live in. Now I have less junk to sift through when looking for something of value&#8211;that&#8217;s time saved.

Plus, what if I had to move soon? What if I were hit by a bus. Do I (or anyone else) need to deal with sifting through a bunch of useless stuff?

You&#8217;ll be surprised how much stuff you have around that you don&#8217;t really need. Spend a weekend&#8230; it&#8217;s fun!

May is still considered Spring right?
