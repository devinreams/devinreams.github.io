My buddy Noah came out to visit last weekend (<a href="http://okdork.com/2007/06/22/mike-moritz-of-sequoia-techstars-and-ali-g/">as he mentioned</a>). He wasn't here to see <em>me</em> but he did live on my couch. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/sets/72157600441193395/">Here's a Flickr set</a> documenting the excitement (Chipotle).
