I think my simplest self-imposed challenge was to: go [entirely paperless at the office][1] this month. It was so simple it&#8217;s almost laughable. I&#8217;m so confident that I met my own goal I&#8217;ve posted this a week before the end of the month. So how did I do it and how did it spill over into my personal life?

### I got the right (portable) tools in place

These days we all have laptops: they&#8217;re light, portable, and can go anywhere. I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have one for both work and play.
