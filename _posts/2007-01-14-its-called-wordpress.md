I&#8217;ve been quietly working on a silly project &#8212; they&#8217;re good to throw into the mix every now and again. It started in the 9rules member forum. A member, [deus62][1], mentioned he was becoming a [WordPress][2] convert. I decided to offer my humble opinion and response in a light-hearted country tune. I do hope you enjoy&#8230;

## Music Video

Yes, I made a(nother) music video. It may not appear in your feed reader so you need to visit this post or [click here to visit Vimeo][3].

[It&#8217;s Called WordPress][3] from [Devin Reams][4] on [Vimeo][5].

## Lyrics

Welcome to my story bout my, [CMS][6]  
It&#8217;s an awesome piece of software, it&#8217;s called [WordPress][7]  
It manages my blog, it makes it look real nice  
I installed in in 5 minutes, this things slicker than ice  
All I had to do, was click on Next  
Within seconds I was running, no room to get vexed

It&#8217;s called [WordPress][8]  
It&#8217;s my CMS  
It&#8217;s the best thing to hit the web since porn  
The code is open, the source is free  
It&#8217;s available for people, just like you and me

Once I picked my title and wrote a description,  
I clicked on manage, I needed to do so me fixin&#8217;  
I deleted Hello World, got rid of first comment, too  
I clicked on View Site and all I saw was plain blue  
I moved to Presentation, there were some nice looking themes  
But none fit my style, none screamed [Devin Reams][9]

Chorus

After I tweaked the code and played with [CSS][10]  
I installed myself some plugins, I was real impressed  
They organized my archives, they helped me tag, too  
Then I installed a spam blocker not a single one came through  
I added movie ratings and book ratings as well  
Now when people visit me they&#8217;ll know that [Crank][12] was hell

Chorus

So I made an [about page][9], it got me a stalker  
I was thrilled and excited, I wanted to to talk to her  
She said she knew my hometown, what I looked like, too  
It was mentioned that she loved guys with eyes that were blue  
I didn&#8217;t mind the attention, decided it was time she had met me  
Little did I know, some people named their [boys Leslie][13]

Chorus

Now you might be thinking, he plays piano real good  
I wish it were true, I sure wish I could  
Instead I wrote the lyrics to this nerdy tune,  
It was [GarageBand][14] provided ballad piano number 2

Chorus x2

**Update:** Steven Campbell has created a plugin (like the Hello Dolly! plugin) for this song. [Check it out!][15]

**Update:** The song is now available in [Japanese][16]!
