Last week brought a number of things to keep me busy. <a href="http://www.cuakpsi.com/">AKPsi</a> began rush events last week, I started some work on a couple of web clients, have constantly been working on <a href="http://www.communitynext.com/">Community Next</a> planning and, of course, school.

	<h2>AKPsi</h2>
	I've been involved in CU's co-ed business fraternity for the last 5 semesters. I pledged, joined as a member, became webmaster and then took over as VP of Operations for a year. For my last semester at school I'm the VP of Membership meaning I plan and manage the pledge process.

	Last week we started rush so I had two information meetings to present at and a Meet and Greet on Friday night. After collecting resumes, some short answer responses and meeting rushees we voted on the new pledge class. It's a lot to manage but I've had some excellent help from my pledge masters.

	<h2>Web work</h2>
	Apparently when people think of having a website created, edited, etc. they think of me. In short, that's great. I've been approached by two student groups and one student-founded company to work on their websites. I'm certainly no design guru but I'm excited to help these groups out.

	<h2>Community Next</h2>
	I'll be in California in 11 days which means Noah and I have a little over a week to finish up the conference details. Sponsorship has been secured, reservations have been made, catering has been paid, gifts have been purchased, and so on. This week Noah and I were accused of being unethical which put a damper on things. In short, a cheater turned around and called me the unfair one. It's been a wild ride...

	<h2>School</h2>

	Meh. I think I'm at work more than I'm in class. Graduation is only 14 Weekly Updates away. Here's to #18!
