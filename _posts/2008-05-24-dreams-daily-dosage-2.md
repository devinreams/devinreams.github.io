Here we are again with some cool stuff I learned, did, and found in the past week:

**Monday**  
Have you ever watched **[a trailer for a business book][1]**? Well, [click this link][1] and you won&#8217;t be able to say that anymore. Dan Pink (awesome!) writes the ultimate career guide (including manga and all) to answer the question we all ask ourselves at work: &#8220;WTF?&#8221;

**Tuesday**  
[**Google Health launched**][2] and, well, I&#8217;m scared. I want to use it. I think? Do I? Hmmm. Yeah, it&#8217;s really something I&#8217;d do (if I ever got sick / went to the doctor / bought medication).

**Wednesday**  
[Noah&#8217;s project][3], [**Brand Tags**][4], has become one of the coolest sources of free marketing insight. Any company not looking at his site is crazy.

**Thursday**  
I &#8220;launched&#8221; my small web-design shop at [**mindaverse.com**][5]. The first person who can figure out the significance of the company name (other than the obvious slogan) wins a $10 gift certificate to anywhere or anything.

**Friday**  
Facebook is doing a great job **[aggregating my online life][6]** so far and I don&#8217;t feel like I need to post things to multiple places anymore. Goodbye Friendfeed and Socialthing?
