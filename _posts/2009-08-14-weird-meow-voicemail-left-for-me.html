From the "I can't make this stuff up" file:

I received a call from what appears to be a shady telemarketing phone number (603-606-4912). I always Google a phone number area code when an unrecognizable number is calling me ("Do I know anyone in Georgia that would call me?") and then Google the full phone number to see if it's even worth worrying about.

Anyway, the funniest point was getting the voicemail. Have a listen:

I figured I'd write about this so when people search the web for "meow voicemail message" they'll realize they're not alone. Oh, and because embedding voicemail is the wave of the future.
