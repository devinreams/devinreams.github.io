I love everything about this music video and [overall campaign for Virgin America&#8217;s safety video][1]. The self-awareness (&#8220;for the .001% of you who have never operated a seatbelt before&#8230;&#8221;), catchiness, and entertainment value is not hard to produce but is a much more enjoyable (required) experience. My guess is other airlines aren&#8217;t doing something like this for two reasons: 1) safety is a priority and should not be relegated to a side show, and 2) it&#8217;s not the way it&#8217;s been done before.

This whole thing makes me step back and wonder why the safety and instructional videos are shown (or demonstrated) in-flight and not something all fliers should pre-qualify for[^1] (like a drivers license test) before getting on a plane.

    [Bruce Schneier][2] or someone similar proposed this when discussing security, TSA, flying, etc.
