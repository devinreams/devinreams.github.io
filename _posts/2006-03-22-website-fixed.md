That was a nice little break. It was becoming pretty hard to come up with new stuff every day. I don&#8217;t know what pace I&#8217;ll resume at, so, we&#8217;ll see how it goes.On a totally related note, welcome home, [Brad][1]. My Spring Break starts, well, right now. I&#8217;ll be gone skiing tomorrow and might try to skydive at some point in the coming week. We&#8217;ll see!
