I was running some numbers today because, well, I hate myspace. Usually I can handle people&#8217;s unique background images and their silly javascript cursors but I hate the crammed, ad-filled look.

<img width="185" height="181" align="right" id="image99" alt="myspace.jpg" src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/myspace.jpg" />I took a screenshot of the &#8216;above-the-fold&#8217; view I see on my resolution (1280&#215;1024). I end up seeing almost a perfect 800&#215;800 square. Now as you can see there are two very prominent ads taking up prime visual space on my home page. The top banner is a 730&#215;90 and the second (much more obnoxious) ad is 300&#215;300 in size. Let&#8217;s do some math:

*   Total Pixels: 800 x 800 = 640,000
*   Banner Ad: 730 x 90 = 65,700
*   Box Ad: 300 x 300 = 90,000
*   Total Ad Space = 65,700 + 90,000 = 155,700
*   Percentage of Page filled with ads: 155,700/640,000 x 100 = **24.3%**

I thought, &#8216;Wow, 1/4 of the page is dedicated to advertising&#8217;. I tried to think of some way to weight the box ad since it&#8217;s right in front of my face. I wasn&#8217;t successfully clever enough. I started thinking some more and I realized, &#8216;is 24% typical?&#8217;

<img width="224" height="141" align="right" id="image98" alt="google.jpg" src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/google.jpg" />Google&#8217;s page does expand to fit the full screen so there may be more total pixels but perhaps a smaller percentage?

*   Total Pixels: 1264 x 800 = 1,012,000
*   Top Links: 935 x 85 = 79,475
*   Side Links: 660 x 300 = 198,000
*   Total Ad Space = 79,475 + 198,000 = 277,475
*   Percentage of Page filled with ads: 277,475/1,012,000 x 100 = **27.4%**

Wow. Perhaps I was quick to jump to conclusions. Google is dedicating more space for ads than Myspace. Granted, the links don&#8217;t take up the entire section and you don&#8217;t even seen them everytime. Additionally, the ads are more-or-less out of the way and certainly less obtrusive than Myspace&#8217;s.

I guess there are a few things to take away from this post. First, quality ads (Google&#8217;s) are important. Second, unobtrusive is a plus. Google has trained me to look to the top/side if I want to spend some money. Myspace is just taking up room and being an ugly annoyance.

Myspace is obviously laughing it&#8217;s way to the bank while I complain. But, hey, this was a fun exercise&#8230;

PS: Facebook is only 15.2% and I couldn&#8217;t name a single ad ever run on the site.
