Exciting news for <a href="http://www.b5media.com">b5media</a> and <a href="http://9rules.com/">9rules</a>. I'll be chastised for putting the two companies in the same sentence but that's alright. b5media, one of my employers, <a href="http://www.b5media.com/b5media-inc-raises-us2-million/">raised $2 million</a> in VC funding. 9rules, some of my best internet pals, has received some <a href="http://9rules.com/blog/2006/10/9rules-receives-cookies/">tasty cookies</a> for all their great work. I don't know which of these two rewards took more work...
