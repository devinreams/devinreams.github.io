I think my &#8216;captcha&#8217; batting average is 300 right now. [Captchas][1] are what we call those annoying boxes at the end of a form, or before you download a file. They show you a jumble of letters and numbers and you have to enter what it is. Apparently this is to circumvent non-human interaction with websites. In other words, to make sure no scripts, bots, or programs are automatically stealing all the concert tickets. Well, so far, I&#8217;m not getting any tickets either..

## I&#8217;m pissed

As mentioned, I&#8217;ve probably fail as many captchas as I pass. You may disagree, but I seem to be a reasonably intelligent person. I figure I can do so much as read a few letters and numbers. Well, apparently not. It seems computers can read as well, if not, better than I can. So, of course, the captchas have to be much more confusing than my eyes could ever decypher. This is stupid &#8212; I&#8217;m wasting at least 30 seconds trying to read the thing, 15 being told I was wrong, and another 30 trying it again. Thanks, assholes.

## I&#8217;m not alone

I can&#8217;t be. Seriously, others must be having trouble reading some of these. I&#8217;ve seen one where the characters are upside down; that takes a lot of energy to figure out. Especially when they warp the character a little. Then that crooked 2 looks like a crooked 5. Or, that sideways 7 could just be a fancy looking L. Oh, and then they throw in the overlay of more characters and numbers. Not only do those throw off computers, they get me too! I can&#8217;t tell light grey from slightly less grey. Thanks, assholes.

## How to fix this

There are things out there that we could all recognize and interpret. Think of inkblots but a lot easier and a lot less quack. Perhaps we could look at an image of a tree. Or maybe of a famous person. Stuff we should all know.

Heck, why not turn it into a 4-second advertisement where I click, it tells me about a product and I type that product name in? What if we just sell logos and have people enter &#8216;coke&#8217; instead of IKHJ21. Couldn&#8217;t we make this easier for everyone?

**We probably could. Why we haven&#8217;t yet, I&#8217;m not sure. If anyone wants to start a third-party captcha provider feel free to drop me a line.**
