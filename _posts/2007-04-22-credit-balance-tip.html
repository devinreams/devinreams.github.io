If you're like me, you enjoy spending all your money using a credit card (bonus miles, reward points, easier to track, etc.). But, when month-end comes and you spent $1,200 of your $1,800 limit it's going to look really bad on your credit score (because you're using a lot of credit). Since I'm paid twice a month I pay my bill twice a month. In other words, pay off your balance half-way through the month to keep your final balance low. Plus, it helps remind your checking account that you are indeed spending <em>real</em> money.
