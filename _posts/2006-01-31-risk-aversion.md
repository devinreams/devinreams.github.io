[Kathy Sierra has a nice post on risk aversion][1] which I especially like because of her awesome &#8216;USAToday approach&#8217; to explaining concepts (using pretty pictures). If you don&#8217;t feel like reading everything she has to say, you can at least loose yourself in a picture of a tree for a few minutes. That point aside, Seth has always said that safe is risky, etc. In my case, I love being a &#8216;leaf node&#8217; and the &#8216;manager&#8217; at the same time. I guess being creative and creating your own products allows you to do that. Fortunately for me I&#8217;m not tied down by a big company. I&#8217;m in college and can play around with whatever I feel like. I can&#8217;t wait to release my current &#8216;project&#8217;&#8230;
