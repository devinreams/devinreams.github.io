[I love my school and the police that protect us from&#8230; ourselves][1]. Smoking pot is a lesser crime than littering, yet they&#8217;ll dedicate [these resources][1] to catching a few teens? Last year the only person given a citation was a kid who set up a snack stand to sell chips. He didn&#8217;t have a vendor permit&#8230;
