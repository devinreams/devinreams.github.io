Today Google announced some &#8220;out of season&#8221; spring cleaning: they will be closing [Google Knol][1] next May. Knol was originally created &#8220;to help improve web content by enabling experts to collaborate on in-depth articles&#8221;.

Because of this, we at [Crowd Favorite][2] worked closely with [Solvitor][3] to create an open-source scholarly authoring and publishing platform based on WordPress that could serve as a new home for Knol users. Personally, I&#8217;ve been involved with this by leading, in conjunction with Solvitor, the design and development efforts around the new WordPress theme available today: [Annotum][4].

*   [Annotum on Github][5] (forks welcome)
*   [Annotum theme on WordPress.org][6]

This theme is unlike any other I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s a sophisticated authoring and publishing platform with numerous features baked in. Originally designed with scientific and scholarly journals in mind, this is a great all-around theme for any publishers.

Knol users can now download their existing content via Google Takeout and take it wherever they&#8217;d like *and/or* set up a Annotum-based WordPress.com blog with a one-click(ish) process.

I&#8217;m excited to see the theme in the wild and proud to have worked with the excellent teams at Crowd Favorite, Solvitor, Google, and Automattic. Here&#8217;s a bit more about the project where you can learn more about it:
