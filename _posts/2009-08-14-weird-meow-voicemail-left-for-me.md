From the &#8220;I can&#8217;t make this stuff up&#8221; file:

I received a call from what appears to be a shady telemarketing phone number (603-606-4912). I always Google a phone number area code when an unrecognizable number is calling me (&#8220;Do I know anyone in Georgia that would call me?&#8221;) and then Google the full phone number to see if it&#8217;s even worth worrying about.

Anyway, the funniest point was getting the voicemail. Have a listen:

I figured I&#8217;d write about this so when people search the web for &#8220;meow voicemail message&#8221; they&#8217;ll realize they&#8217;re not alone. Oh, and because embedding voicemail is the wave of the future.
