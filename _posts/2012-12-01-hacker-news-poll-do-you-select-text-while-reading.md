I found a poll over at Hacker News via John Siracusa:

> I am surprised at how many people, like me, who select text to highlight what they are reading. Some reasons include tracking your reading position, increasing text contrast, or as an &#8220;intra-page&#8221; bookmark.

It seems natural for me to highlight as I go and I almost didn&#8217;t realize I do this. I wonder if others have noticed it. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen anyone (friends or coworkers) do it&#8230;
