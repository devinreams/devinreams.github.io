There will be a few weeks of little things here and there, but, yes, it&#8217;s over. The first WordPress conference in Denver has come and gone and I survived. Thanks to [Alex][1] and [Rachel][2] for their help running the conference and doing the legwork I couldn&#8217;t get to. A big thanks to the volunteers who showed up early to help out: Mike, Mike, and Kristal. Finally, a big thanks to the speakers who came to speak.

So far, the feedback coming in is great. As always, you can&#8217;t please everybody all the time. Plus, shit happens; it&#8217;s to be expected. I don&#8217;t think we would&#8217;ve done too much differently, though. There are always trade-offs and I think we did the best we could given the circumstances.

Denver has attracted a ton of talent and interesting individuals and I hope [WordCamp][3] was a good event for them. I&#8217;ll post some thoughts and experiences over at [Mind Averse][4] when I get a few minutes.
