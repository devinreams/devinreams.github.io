One more year finished. I had my last final on Tuesday morning&#8230; at 7:30. Just thinking about it made me think, &#8220;wow, that sucks.&#8221; It was my database class, too. It certainly wasn&#8217;t at the top of my list of priorities since I&#8217;m pretty proficient at Microsoft Access. In any case, I got a friendly call at 7:45am from a friend in the class&#8230; wondering where I was. Apparently my answer was &#8220;in bed.&#8221; I strolled in around 8 and finished up in an hour. I think I was the second one done. I bet I looked like an ass&#8230;
