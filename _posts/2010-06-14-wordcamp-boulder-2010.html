As with last year[^1], [Crowd Favorite](http://crowdfavorite.com/) will be hosting and organizing the local [WordCamp conference for the Denver/Boulder area](http://2010.boulder.wordcamp.org). If you don't know, WordCamp is a WordPress conference for people of various backgrounds and interests (it's like no other conference I can think of). I'm excited to see how our [Hydeified](http://andrewhy.de) approach works out this year. We're always open to suggestions and ideas, feel free to reach out.

[^1]: I organized WordCamp Denver 2009 at the Denver Art Museum. I wrote a [recap](http://devin.reams.me/wordcamp-denver-2009-organizer-recap/) here.
