<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4921116.stm">Do dead bodies have human rights</a>? Apparently so. Personally, I think extra organs is a great thing for everyone. I don't agree with the Chinese making a substantial profit off of someone else's organs... but should they be collected? Of course.
