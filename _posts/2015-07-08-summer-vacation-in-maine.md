This summer we came back to visit Maine with Rachel's family. We spent time at a very nice house (big and usually for weddings) in Harpswell, spent a lot of timing driving around to nearby Brunswick, Bath, and Freeport.

And then Rachel and I spent an extra week, just us, visiting with friends down in Portland.
