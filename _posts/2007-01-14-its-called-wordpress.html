I've been quietly working on a silly project -- they're good to throw into the mix every now and again. It started in the 9rules member forum. A member, <a href="http://www.livingwithmusic.com/">deus62</a>, mentioned he was becoming a <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> convert. I decided to offer my humble opinion and response in a light-hearted country tune. I do hope you enjoy...

<h2>Music Video</h2>

Yes, I made a(nother) music video. It may not appear in your feed reader so you need to visit this post or <a href="http://vimeo.com/25840232">click here to visit Vimeo</a>.

<h2>Lyrics</h2>

Welcome to my story bout my, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a>
It's an awesome piece of software, it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress">WordPress</a>
It manages my blog, it makes it look real nice
I installed in in 5 minutes, this things slicker than ice
All I had to do, was click on Next
Within seconds I was running, no room to get vexed

It's called <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>
It's my CMS
It's the best thing to hit the web since porn
The code is open, the source is free
It's available for people, just like you and me

Once I picked my title and wrote a description,
I clicked on manage, I needed to do so me fixin'
I deleted Hello World, got rid of first comment, too
I clicked on View Site and all I saw was plain blue
I moved to Presentation, there were some nice looking themes
But none fit my style, none screamed <a href="http://devinreams.com/about/">Devin Reams</a>

Chorus

After I tweaked the code and played with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>
I installed myself some plugins, I was real impressed
They organized my archives, they helped me tag, too
Then I installed a spam blocker not a single one came through
I added movie ratings and <a href="http://devinreams.com/tools/">book ratings</a> as well
Now when people visit me they'll know that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0479884%2F&ei=InKqRb7HEZGygwPJo5HOBg&usg=__cEAiCZlysS84wW-f8SImhZ7pyE0=&sig2=1xt6BK05r7gEOU1nsHesTQ">Crank</a> was hell

Chorus

So I made an <a href="http://devinreams.com/about/">about page</a>, it got me a stalker
I was thrilled and excited, I wanted to to talk to her
She said she knew my hometown, what I looked like, too
It was mentioned that she loved guys with eyes that were blue
I didn't mind the attention, decided it was time she had met me
Little did I know, some people named their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisex_names">boys Leslie</a>

Chorus

Now you might be thinking, he plays piano real good
I wish it were true, I sure wish I could
Instead I wrote the lyrics to this nerdy tune,
It was <a href="http://www.apple.com/garageband/">GarageBand</a> provided ballad piano number 2

Chorus x2

<strong>Update:</strong> Steven Campbell has created a plugin (like the Hello Dolly! plugin) for this song. <a href="http://www.noenemies.com/archives/244">Check it out!</a>
