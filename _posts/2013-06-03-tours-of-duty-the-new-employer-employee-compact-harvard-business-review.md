I really enjoyed this [HBR article by Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha, and Chris Yeh on &#8220;the New Employer-Employee Compact&#8221;][1]:

> The key to the new employer-employee compact we envision is that although it’s not based on loyalty, it’s not purely transactional, either. It’s an alliance between an organization and an individual that’s aimed at helping both succeed. 

These are smart guys and this is a great read for any person working for (or managing) any business in any industry at any level. I especially enjoy the action items&#8230;
