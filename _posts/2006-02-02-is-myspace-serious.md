I may regret saying this but: what the fuck, [myspace][1]? I tried to log in to it today [for the second time][2] and it was down. You either hate me, your users, or some mixture of both. &#8220;Login is temporarily disabled while we fix some database problems. We&#8217;ll be back shortly. 2/2/2006&#8243; So many questions flow through my mind at this point. What happens to the people already logged in? Why can I see every other part of the site except the one page that says &#8216;processing login&#8217;? What can really be wrong with the database that this one function has to be disabled? Why is this site so damn ugly? So on and so forth&#8230; why don&#8217;t people demand better service from one of the largest websites in the world? Teenagers are the last people I&#8217;d expect to be so complacent&#8230;
