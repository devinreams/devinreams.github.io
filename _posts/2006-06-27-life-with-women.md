I&#8217;ve taken on a fun little project, a webcomic. I have little-to-no artistic ability but I have a lot of funny material. I&#8217;m debating, though, do the comic in MS Paint or draw by hand? Anyway, the comic is called [Life With Women][1] and I plan to provide a weekly dose of entertainment. If you just read this thinking I&#8217;m sexist or perhaps offensive, that&#8217;s fine, it just means you didn&#8217;t [go visit the site and read my introduction][1].
