title: Where I've Been (at Work)

In March 2017 [I joined Mozilla](/2017/joining-mozilla/) and proceeded to have a busy four years where I:
- helped build a team that launched a mobile companion app to Firefox for password management (Lockbox then Lockwise)
- coached and transitioned two lead engineers to become full-time people managers
- was promoted to Senior Engineering Manager
- visited San Francisco, Austin, Orlando, Whistler, and Berlin for our semi-annual "All Hands" meetings
- co-led an experimental project to sell professional services to companies
- took over the in-browser Developer Tools product and engineering teams
- grew my portfolio to include our Internationalization and Accessibility engineering teams
- had to said goodbye to great team members after two rounds of layoffs and re-structuring

And we had two babies! (I took parental leave in October 2017 and December 2020)

As the direct manager of over 50 different people in my tenure I spent a lot of time focusing on **people**. One team member could be solid and stable one day and then tragedy hits them the next.

And as a leader responsible for a variety of different product and business areas I needed to make sure our **plans** was clear, especially with things changing around us so quickly.

Then I needed to make sure our **processess** properly supported the things we wanted to do: everything from weekly routines to quality control and decision making needed to be clear.

*This is now one of my core frameworks for my own prioritization and time management: People. Plan. Process.*

Of course the pandemic brought a lot of interesting challenges...

1. working remotely: which luckily both Mozilla and I were already very equipped and used-to
2. childcare: Rachel and I juggled taking meetings while our two-year old was home with us
3. the economy: early search revenue decreases and consumer spending meant cost-cutting

I wasn't successful at everything. And I know I let some people down at times. But overall feedback from my colleagues was extremely positive. I heard that I created space for product managers in an engineering-led organzation. I took care of people with empathy while maintaining accountability. I knew enough to be helpful (I say: dangerous) but trusted people to act and lead with autonomy.

After some reflection, mostly while feeding and playing with my kids during parental leave in early 2021, I realized I had drifted away from the technology and wanted to get back to mobile app development...

In May 2021 I was presented an awesome opportunity to help lead the bigger-but-growing, established-yet-dynamic mobile engineering team at Smartsheet. I had a lot of fun taking what I had learned and quickly re-applying it:
- jumping into an old product and helping the team make new and big things happen (Mobile Offline Forms)
- building a hiring plan and sourcing and recruiting new engineers to the team
- changing the organization and structure to support existing relationships, unlock new team abilities
- helping the team "shift left" and evolve our testing and release practices
- managing and negotiating key vendor relationships
- learning more about effective big company practices (communication, decision making, culture setting)

I really enjoy, respect and appreciate everyone on the team. It's a solid group of engineers doing hard work and with so much more fun to come.

I saw myself leading mobile engineering people and projects for years to come. But in the fall of 2022 I was introduced to a CEO of a startup... more on that later.
