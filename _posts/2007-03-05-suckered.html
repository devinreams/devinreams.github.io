I hate the (RED) campaign and everyone associated with it (both the consumers and the companies advocating it). <a href="http://www.joshspear.com/item/less-vs-red-update/">Josh Spear</a> has posted a neat little news clip about it. CNN says:

	<center><strong>It has cost <font size=+1>$100M</font> to market the campaign while only raising <font size=-2>$18M</font> for charity.</strong></center>

	No kidding? Get people to "give" more by spending more on themselves? Sigh.
