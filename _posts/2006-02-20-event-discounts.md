Why don&#8217;t awesome events have student discounts? I can start rattling off a list of big events I would kill to go to this year (or last, or probably even next). But, they cost something like $300, $500 or even $1000-plus. [Jeremy pointed out][1] [Blogonomics][2] today. It sounds like an **awesome** trip. Why don&#8217;t the folks putting on big events start setting aside some student tickets? We&#8217;d love to participate, too&#8230; unfortunately some of us have to pay for a lot of schooling though. How about a send-Devin-to-Blogonomics fund? I&#8217;ll sell my soul, I&#8217;ll do anything!
