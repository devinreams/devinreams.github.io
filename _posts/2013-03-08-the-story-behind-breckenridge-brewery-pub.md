A few weeks ago I published a look at one of my favorite restaurants and breweries in Colorado over at the [Breckenridge Connection blog: Breckenridge Brewery & Pub][1]. You don&#8217;t have to twist my arm to get me to go for happy hour when up in Breckenridge. Check it out if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about the little brewery that was early to the craft brewing scene here in Colorado (going on 20+ years now).
