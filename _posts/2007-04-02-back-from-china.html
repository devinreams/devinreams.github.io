My throat is sore from the Shanghai pollution but it was worth it. China was awesome. I've got some pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/">up on Flickr</a> now. Click around and leave your comments. A lot of stuff I did wasn't documented with photos so I will be making a China journal in the coming days. Now I've got a lot of catching up to do...
