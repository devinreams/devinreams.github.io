## Rachel and I had a nice weekend in San Francisco from November 14 &#8211; 17, 2013.

I spent Thursday and Friday in meetings. Then Rachel flew out Friday evening to spend a couple days seeing sights and catching up with friends together. We hiked around town and visited some places we hadn&#8217;t visited yet (and some we had):

*   Yerba Buena Gardens
*   Nob Hill
*   Coit Tower
*   the Ferry Building and various piers
*   Golden Gate Park, and
*   the California Academy of Sciences

I plan to be out in San Francisco quite a bit more next year and am really looking forward to it.
