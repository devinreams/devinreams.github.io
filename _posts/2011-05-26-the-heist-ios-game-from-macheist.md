[The team behind MacHeist has released a $0.99 iPhone/iPod touch game.][1] [MacHeist][2] has raised over $2 million dollars for charity in the past by creating fun mission-based games and selling bundles of Mac software for heavy discounts. This new offering, an iOS game has four classic game types (like one similar to soduku) with varying degrees of difficulty. The best part: you can ultimately unlock what I presume to be a download code for Steam&#8217;s <strike>very popular Portal</strike> game called Eets (via [GigaOm][3]) For only 99 cents, it&#8217;s a beautiful game, innovative, very well done, and worth a [download][4].
