It looks like not only [Nike][1], but [Honda also understands how to advertise][2]. The commercial found on their site (skip the flash, &#8216;Watch&#8217;) is a classic example of something so neat it&#8217;ll get passed around very quickly. How do I know? Popular demand has made the &#8216;making of&#8217; video unavailable.. Honda also gets bonus points for making a downloadable podcast version available. No longer does someone have to rip the ad and put it on their site&#8230; well, maybe someone should anyway since Honda&#8217;s own site can&#8217;t handle the downloads.
