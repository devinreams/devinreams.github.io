I went skiing today and would like to point out that I&#8217;ve been on the [highest chair lift in North America][1]. It brought us to nearly 13,000 feet. The wind was crazy but the view was spectacular. In order to construct it they used a helicopter that could lift up to 10 tons of steel (at sea level). They have a video on their site. In any case, if you felt extra-ambitious you could hike up to the very top of the peak and ski down some other bowls&#8230; I&#8217;ll just say that getting to the top was enough excitement for me today.
