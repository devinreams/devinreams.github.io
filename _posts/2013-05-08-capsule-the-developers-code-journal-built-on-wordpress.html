The team at <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/">Crowd Favorite</a> has been working on a solution to a problem a lot of designers and developers (and folks that work with designers and developers) didn't quite realize they had: when working on a project you typically take notes on the side... but you usually throw that away and lose the snippets of code, outlines of todos, open questions and decisions, etc.

<blockquote>
  <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/capsule/">Capsule</a> replaces that scratch document you have open when you're coding. It creates an archive of your development artifacts.
</blockquote>

Instead of keeping a text file open when working on a project, using Capsule means you can have a simple archive of all those notes and easily reference them in the future.

Initial reactions and reception have been very positive from the development and WordPress community so we're all very pleased.

Be sure to check out <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2013/04/24/capsule-the-developers-code-journal">Alex's post on Capsule</a> to read more about the thinking and decisions behind this (free) product.
