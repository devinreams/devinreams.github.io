The full title of the book is: <span class="highlight">The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less, How the Culture of Abundance Robs Us of Satisfaction</span>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005688">Here it is on Amazon</a>.

	<strong>Devin determined...</strong> this book is a must-read. Some parts get a little complicated for just a quick read. But, at 240 pages this is a a fun look at the societal and psychological issues we face.

	The areas explored are summed up with the following:
	<blockquote>...our experience of <span class="highlight">choice as a burden rather than a privilege</span> is not a simple phenomenon. Rather it is the result of a complex interaction among many psychological processes that permeate our culture, including rising expectations, awareness of opportunity costs, aversion to trade-offs, adaptation, regret, self-blame, the tendency to engage in social comparisons, and maximizing.</blockquote>

	The last chapter goes on to highlight and explain how we can try to avoid these issues (regret leading to depression, leading to suicide; comparing to neighbors and having regret; post-decision regret). A lot of it has to do with accepting "good enough" which <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/golden_happines.html">Scott Adams recently talked about on his blog</a>.

	Again, <span class="highlight">I recommend the book because it may help you see your decisions a little differently</span>. At the same time, it helps understand the psychology behind others' decisions.
