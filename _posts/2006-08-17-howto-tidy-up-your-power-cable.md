Not really but I sometimes impress myself with my ability to put two and two together. Remember that time I made an [infrared receiver for my keyboard][2]? I took another binder clip, taped it to the back of my desk, put my MacBook power cable through it and tada, no annoying power cable on the desk (nor falling behind it). [Click here for the pictures][3]. I know, I know, pretty clever eh?
