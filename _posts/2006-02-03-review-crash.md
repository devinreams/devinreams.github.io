I watched [Crash][1] last weekend and it was fantastic. Today I noticed that [it was nominated for a few Acadamy Awards][2].

Rightfully so.

<img width="67" height="96" align="right" alt="crash.jpg" id="image85" src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/crash.jpg" />This movie is a &#8216;simultanious drama&#8217; where many peoples&#8217; lives are intertwined. In short, Crash is an awesome look at racism and how it motivates people&#8217;s behavior. As Malcolm Gladwell has said, we can&#8217;t just ignore race. Our mind constantly &#8216;thin slices&#8217; the world around us. Unfortunately, we have little to no control over this process&#8230;

The characters in the movie demonstrate this point through some of society&#8217;s most extreme sterotypes, beliefs, and their respective actions (and reactions). Crash is, as [IMDB][1] describes it, a &#8220;no-nonsense look at the way life is for so many&#8221;. I especially liked this opening quote:

> &#8220;It&#8217;s the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We&#8217;re always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.&#8221;

I&#8217;d give this movie a 10/10. If you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, you know what you need to do now&#8230;
