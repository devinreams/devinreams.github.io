This week is one of vacation for some of us in the states. I have the entire week off to rest, relax, and think about what it is I&#8217;m thankful for. Naturally, I wanted to share some of the things I&#8217;ve been thankful for this year; without the following I wouldn&#8217;t be who I am nor where I am today.

So, with that said, **I&#8217;m thankful for&#8230;**

## My massage chair from Wal-Mart

Sure, it cost me a solid three C-notes and it took over 20 minutes to setup but it&#8217;s what makes my room worth coming home to. Long day at work? Set everything down, kick off your shoes, lay back and relax. Fight with the girl? Turn the massage up a bit more. Feeling a bit feisty? Turn on the butt massage function and giggle the worries away. Plus, the heated massage function is much cheaper than actually turning on the furnace; the thing has practically paid for itself.

## Dell monitors

Nothing makes my eyes happier than my LCD monitors. They take up nearly three feet of my six-foot wide desk. I&#8217;ve named them &#8216;Biggie&#8217; and &#8216;Rotated&#8217; and combined they display over 3,614,720 pixels. That&#8217;s over 3 million unique light sources designed for me and my eyes. These monitors have brought me such memories as: Lost Season 2, countless episodes of Mythbusters, The Office, that one time that girl poked me on Facebook, oh they were also there the whole time I downloaded The Fray&#8217;s new CD. These monitors and I have been through a lot and I can&#8217;t think of any better friends to share my life with.

## Slippers

Perhaps the most overlooked article of clothing, slippers are my new &#8216;winter flip-flop&#8217;. You slip them on, head out the door and now you&#8217;ve got warmer lazy footwear keeping you company. I can&#8217;t think of the numerous inappropriate occasions I&#8217;ve worn my slippers. To work at Six Flags, skiing, Chipotle, to work in Boulder, to school in Boulder, to AKPsi meetings. They&#8217;re so fashionable it&#8217;s not until I&#8217;m leaving that someone finally looks down and asks &#8216;are those slippers&#8217;? This Thanksgiving I&#8217;m proud to say, yes, yes they are. They keep me dry and fuzzy and I&#8217;m thankful I can enjoy those sensations this winter.

That&#8217;s just a taste of what I&#8217;m thankful for this year. What is it you&#8217;re thankful for?
