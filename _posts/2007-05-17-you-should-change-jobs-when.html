Do you feel like you deserve a little better? Are you not being challenged enough? Well, then perhaps it's time to move on. Maybe a new boss, different company, perhaps even a new career. Whatever it may be, you know you should change jobs when...

		<li><strong>You take the longer way to the bathroom.</strong> You know, past the windows. So you can see the outside world.</li>
		<li><strong>You get excited when the fire-alarm goes off.</strong> Either everything is going up in flames or you just earned a 15 minute paid break.</li>
		<li><strong>You get coffee twelve times before noon.</strong> Hey, the more walking, the less work. And the more coffee, the more bathroom breaks.</li>
		<li><strong>You feel accomplished when you take home office supplies.</strong> Especially by accident. What an awesome surprise. A free pen!</li>
		<li><strong>You go to lunch at 2:00pm.</strong> Not because you're working too hard but because you know when you get back you've only got an hour or so until quitting time.</li>
		<li><strong>You start parking further and further away.</strong> "Well, I made it to the office parking lot by 8:00, but the walk put me in my chair at 8:09. I think that means I get to leave 10 minutes early, too."</li>
		<li><strong>You check your co-workers' schedules to avoid confrontation.</strong> "It looks like my boss has a meeting from 4 to 5... I bet I could slide out at 4:30."</li>
		<li><strong>Mandatory time off sounds good.</strong> Who needs to get paid? At least you're not at work!</li>
		<li><strong>You use Outlook's 'Do not deliver before' option.</strong> Nothing says 'good employee' when you spend Friday afternoon scheduling a few emails to go out on late Saturday night.</li>
		<li><strong>You make lists about changing jobs...</strong> at work.</li>
