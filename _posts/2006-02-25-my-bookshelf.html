We know what <a href="http://brandautopsy.typepad.com/brandautopsy/2006/02/whatcha_reading.html">John Moore is reading</a> and what's on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/02/whats_on_your_v.html">Kathy Sierra's (virtual) coffee table</a>. I decided I'd take a look and see what I've been reading.

I couldn't agree more. I remember someone walking into our house one day and the magazines on the coffee table gave an insightful look at who I was and what I was into. They mentioned how great the magazines were and he and I quickly found some common ground (The magazines were Fortune, Cargo, PC Magazine, and FastCompany). I no longer have magazines on my coffee table but I certainly have a growing pile of books lying around. These are the books I'm in the process of reading:

...and these are the books on my shelf. Most have been read while a few will sit there until I feel it's appropriate to read them.

I wish I had more time to read becuase I have a lot more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/1DQNZ2USUEZYN/104-0574579-4801538">books piling up in queue</a>. My goal is to finish a book a month and so far im 0/2. I think it's best I get back on track...

What's on your bookshelf? Is it a pretty accurate portrayal of who you are and your interests? Mine certainly are. I love business, marketing, blogs, history, and technology. What about you?
