The Denver Post&#8217;s Andy Vuong highlights the [four Denver-based companies that will be involved in TechStars Boulder][1] this summer. [Elihuu][2] being one of them:

> &#8220;[Designers have] tested the market, they&#8217;ve figured out price points, they&#8217;ve figured out materials, they&#8217;ve figured out processes â€” and they need to get this thing manufactured,&#8221; said co-founder Dorian Ferlauto. &#8220;They come to us and we find them the best matches.&#8221; 

Its great that the [multiple TechStars locations][3] (Boulder, NYC, Seattle, Boston, etc.) has allowed for these locales to help &#8216;bring up&#8217; local companies instead of &#8216;ship in&#8217; entrepreneurs from around the country (sure, that still does happen).

But, this also means there&#8217;s more tendency for those folks who started a company locally to maintain and grown their network, continue to stay in town where their mentors and funders reside, grow a startup ecosystem, find more resources, stick around, and turn around and mentor the future incomers. I may be overstating, but in the early days, most successful TechStars companies simply moved to California shortly after getting investments after demo day&#8230;
