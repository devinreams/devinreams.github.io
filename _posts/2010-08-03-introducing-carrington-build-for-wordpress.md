The team at [Crowd Favorite][1] has been working on one of the most innovative drag-and-drop page layout tools I&#8217;ve ever seen. In fact, I can&#8217;t think of a web-based content management system with anything like this. We call it [Carrington Build][2] and it&#8217;s been very popular with current and potential clients alike. In fact, the ability to quickly create a page layout with drag-and-drop abilities helped me and the team build our [own company website][1] quickly and easily (no custom coding required).

I enjoyed being a part of the packaging, delivery and marketing of [Carrington Build][3] and it&#8217;s corresponding WordPress theme, [Carrington Business][4]. Helping oversee internal initiatives like this are much different than managing any client project because we are our own boss. It&#8217;s pretty unique, actually.

Anyway, if you&#8217;re a WordPress designer, developer, or are an organization looking for a top-notch WordPress theme for your website check it out.
