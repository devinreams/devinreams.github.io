It was nice to sit down and have a conversation, include the term &#8216;WordPress&#8217; and not be the only one to understand what the hell it is. But seriously, it was fun and interesting and I got to chat with [some cool folks][3] (ones I had only seen and heard about online). I look forward to future geek events around town&#8230;
