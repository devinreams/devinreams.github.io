I had a great time at the first-ever [Monktoberfest][1] conference last Thursday (October 6, 2011). By day: an intimate &#8220;social&#8221; conference. By night: a wonderful meal with world-class beer pairings. Cheers to all the speakers, sponsors, and participants; I enjoyed every minute.

Friday and Saturday was spent with friends recovering and seeing the sights that the Portland area has to offer. We&#8217;re looking forward to returning in the near future.
