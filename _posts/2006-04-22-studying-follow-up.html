I nearly forgot I had written about my secrets to exam success: <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/03/01/studying-for-tests/">Studying for Tests</a>. If you initially doubted me, that's fine, I would be hesitant too. Let me assure you I received very high A's on both accounting tests the second time around. As mentioned, take the first test and set the pace for the rest of the semester... do yourself a favor and focus on all those other important things during your extra time. That's what I do!
