<a href="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/Picture%201.png" rel="lightbox" title="me.dium view of WSJ"/><img src="http://devinreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/Picture%201.thumbnail.png" alt="" align="right"/> David Cohen from <a href="http://coloradostartups.com/?p=147">ColoradoStartups.com</a> pointed to a neat tool today. It's called <a href="http://me.dium.com/">me.dium</a> and it's a browser tool that tracks your surfing behavior and helps you determine relevant sites near you. While browsing you have the option of viewing your me.dium map. This map shows sites "near" you in terms of relevancy. The relevancy is determined by a number of things based on users' surfing patterns (and a slew of other things, I'm sure). For example, the Wall Street Journal yields the map shown here.

As you can see, sites like USAToday, the NY Times and Washington Post show up as sites near your current page. If other users happened to be browsing these sites (or the one you're on) you can actually communicate with them and add them as a 'friend'.

I like this tool so far because it helps me draw connections that I (and others) might not otherwise make. Sites like StumbleUpon and digg are great but they require a human to make a conscious decision. I'd need to find something interesting or something relevant and go through some sort of process to flag that page. In me.diums case, it does all this for you.

Currently, me.dium is in private beta and constantly looking for feedback and improvements. I've only been surfing for a few hours but it's a very interesting concept.. <strong>If you'd like to try it out </strong>(the more users, the better a tool like this works) then <strong>leave a comment telling me who you are, where you're from, and how you first found my site</strong>. If you're a CU student then you can just signup with your @colorado.edu address (me.dium is local to Boulder, CO).
