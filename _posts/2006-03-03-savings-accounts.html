I'm in the process of managing my finances and I realized: a lot of people don't earn money with their money. In other words, your Wells Fargo savings account is only earning you... what... 8/10ths of a percent? Your money is wasting time in there! If I'm not mistaken, you're earning money slower than prices are inflating. Heck, you may be <strong>losing</strong> money.

Well then, what do you do? Simple: find a <strong>high interest savings account or put some money in a CD</strong>.

Personally, I do both. Since I only pay tuition two times a year I can lock my cash into a CD for a few months (6, 12, etc) and then use it once I actually need it. Money that would have just been sitting around waiting to pay for college has earned me over $400. It's just that easy...

But, what about the short-term money? Well, I transfer all my cash into an ING Direct account. This savings account earns me 3.8% and through April, my new deposits are earnign 4.75%. I've already earned $30 in the first few months. Sometimes a number doesn't say much so I need to look at it a different way. That $30 is the same as <strong>6 free burritos</strong>. Can you imagine a mini pyramid of burritos every month? It's a great thought...

I guess my point is this: put your money away and let it earn some interest. ING works in a funny way, though. What you do is 'link' an existing bank account to it. This serves as a direct connection between the two accounts and you easily (within 2 business days) transfer money in and out. To me, the money <em>seems</em> more difficult to get to. This acts as a barrier to spending and allows me to earn more burritos.

So, to everyone out there with their money sitting around, <strong>open an ING Direct account</strong> <strong>and get $25 for free</strong>. Thats right. If you <strong>leave a comment here</strong> with your email I will send you an invitation. Once you make an initial deposit of $250 you'll automatically earn $25. Again, thats like 5 free burritos and, well, they taste even better when they're free.

Plus, if you open an account I'll earn $10 and that's pretty awesome. If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment.
