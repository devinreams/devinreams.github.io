I&#8217;ve been trying out the new version of \[Apple Mail\](http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/mail.html) in OS X Lion and it&#8217;s really nice. I would say it&#8217;s 90% of what I want in a native (e.g.: not web-based, like Gmail) email client. One thing \[Alex\](http://alexking.org/) and I noticed was that the new two-column view (view the message alongside the list of messages) forces a new problematic workflow.

\## Two-column view forces unread status

When you remove a message from the current mailbox, for example you delete or file the message away, you&#8217;re automatically pushed into viewing the next message in the mailbox. This marks the next message read every time you act upon an email.

If you didn&#8217;t want to reply to that next message and hoped to keep it &#8220;unread&#8221; so you know to follow-up, well, you&#8217;re now forced to mark a message as unread every single time you do something in your mailbox. That&#8217;s annoying and a lot of extra work.

\## Maybe I&#8217;m the problem

But then I thought about it more, and it seems that I may have been doing it wrong this whole time. Instead of keeping any email I need to follow-up marked &#8220;unread&#8221; in my inbox (or any other mailbox), why not treat unread as &#8220;have not yet read this&#8221; — as the name of the status implies.

There&#8217;s no real good reason to keep marking things &#8220;unread&#8221; in an Inbox, if you treat it as a true Inbox: something comes in, you then need to take action and get rid of it.

By allowing things I&#8217;ve actually &#8220;seen&#8221; and &#8220;read&#8221; to change status, the unread counter in my dock or on my phone are true representations of what has not been seen by me yet.

Then, the remaining &#8220;read&#8221; messages in my inbox are items that need action taken: a response, to be filed away, a follow-up task to do something, etc. This forces the need for me to get a clean &#8220;inbox zero&#8221; inbox and I don&#8217;t have a crazy scary &#8220;unread&#8221; count that I need to think about every time I glance at my phone: &#8220;23 unread? Does that mean I already got seven, or was it eight, new emails since I last checked?&#8221;

\## Switching to Sparrow

While Apple Mail is great, I&#8217;ve found \[Sparrow\](http://sparrowmailapp.com/) has helped me stick to the Gmail-style email that I&#8217;ve come to love with all the benefits of a native app: offline email storage, fast searching, a dedicated (full-screen) window. It&#8217;s worth checking out.
