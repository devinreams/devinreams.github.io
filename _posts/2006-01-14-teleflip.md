I just found a nice site: [teleflip.com][1]. It lets you email any phone by just sending a message to phonenumber@teleflip.com. No longer do I need to find out someone?s provider and email syntax. Plus, they can reply right back to you. In the past I?ve used AIM to send people messages but I think I?ll be trying this one out for a bit.
