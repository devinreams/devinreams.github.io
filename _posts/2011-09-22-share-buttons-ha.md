As soon as I saw Facebook&#8217;s new &#8220;Ticker&#8221; (a.k.a. Facebook within Facebook) I wondered if Facebook was smart enough to &#8220;surface&#8221; the right stories to me. [MG Siegler at TechCrunch][1]:

> But while all the competitors were busy making that button, Facebook was busy making the button obsolete. Today’s Open Graph changes represent a world where the button isn’t needed. Sure, it will continue to exist for certain types of content. But it will be more like an on/off switch.

Once I saw the long term plan (with the new Timeline), it became clear that the Ticker is the new Beacon. Facebook is told about everything you do. Then between a mix of curation (updating my Timeline) and algorithm (Facebook determining what is important) the stream of updates within Facebook will become meaningful again.

Or, at least, thats the hope.
