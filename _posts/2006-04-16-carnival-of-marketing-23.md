This week I&#8217;m hosting the [Carnival of Marketing][1] and I&#8217;ve got 7 great articles to share with you. Enjoy!

[Seth Godin &#8211; Marketing in the Car Business][2]

> &#8220;We should not try to educate or teach the customer about what he or she wants.&#8221; Oh.

[The Fast Growth Blog &#8211; Are Your Employees &#8220;Raving Fans?&#8221;][3]

> &#8220;Think about all of the money spent on marketing and sales &#8212; all of the ?customer outreach? initiatives, loyalty programs, special offers, etc. How much money is spent to support making employees ?raving fans? of the employer?&#8221;

[Jim Logan &#8211; Stop Playing It Safe, you&#8217;re Boring Us To Death!][4]

> Odds favor that whatever your competition is doing to build their business is exactly what you shouldn?t be doing.

[Career Intensity Blog &#8211; Get A New Job Offer Every Month][5]

> Creating opportunity is not just a good idea ? it is your responsibility. How many job offers (or new pieces of business for you entrepreneurs) have you received this year?

[Fire Someone Today &#8211; Authentic advertising, cyborg style][6]

> A pretty girl wearing a video screen is as blatant a ?look at me!? advertisement as there is. But it is also a chance to tell a story, because unlike a poster or billboard, your live saleslady can actually talk to your customers. Maybe she should get to try the product.

[7CM Marketing Blog &#8211; The Importance of Using Keywords In Blogs][7]

> Choose a few keywords or short phrases, and work them into your blog entry. Don&#8217;t over do it! Nobody wants to read a blog that&#8217;s just an obvious set of keywords.

&#8230;and to finish off the day with a post with some Easter Sunday relevance:

[Church Relevance &#8211; How to Find a Church for Easter][8]

> ?If I never went to church, how would I know when to show up on time??

&#8230;and there you have it. I hope you enjoy these posts as much as I did. Next week be sure to stop by [firesomeonetoday.com][9].
