Wow, print media isn't entirely dead but I was definitely convinced that advertising in it was (what are <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin's</a> thoughts?). <a href="http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2006/02/08/google-unveils-print-ad-program/">Google certainly changed some things today</a>. I had recommended people to steer clear of print advertising but, hey, I apologize: I was wrong. I'm excited to turn around and recommend print advertising at <a href="http://www.influencesystems.com/">work</a> tomorrow!
