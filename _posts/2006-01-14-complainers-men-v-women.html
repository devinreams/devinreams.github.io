Scott Adams yet again puts life into perspective. The following gems should sum up <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/01/men_versus_wome_1.html">his latest post</a>. "Complainers rarely mate with other complainers" and "Statistically speaking, if your mate is upbeat, there?s a very good chance that  you?re a huge pain in the ass". If you've missed out, the latest acronym out there is BOCTAE, meaning, 'but of course, there are exceptions'. Try it out, impress your friends.
