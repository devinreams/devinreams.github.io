[Ryan pointed ][1]to the very cool online quiz (slash hardcover book) called [Strengths Finder 2.0][2]. It&#8217;s a great tool (over 150 questions) that helps you determine what you should *really* focus on.

Society says we should overcome our weaknesses. We should conquer that which we apparently cannot. I think our country was founded on that. Our movies certainly like telling stories about it ([Rudy][3] is the example given in the book). That seems silly; keep doing what you&#8217;re really good at. This test shows you where you have potential of developing your strongest talents.

It was definitely worth the $20; I went to the store, picked it up, read the book and took the test. An hour later I know a lot more about myself. Here are my results (my top 5 strengths).

1.  **MAXIMIZER** &#8211; People who are especially talented in the Maximizer theme focus on strengths as a way to stimulate personal and group excellence. They seek to transform something strong into something superb.
2.  **LEARNER** &#8211; People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.
3.  **ACHIEVER** &#8211; People who are especially talented in the Achiever theme have a great deal of stamina and work hard. They take great satisfaction from being busy and productive.
4.  **SELF-ASSURANCE** &#8211; People who are especially talented in the Self-Assurance theme feel confident in their ability to manage their own lives. They possess an inner compass that gives them confidence that their decisions are right.
5.  **ARRANGER** &#8211; People who are especially talented in the Arranger theme can organize, but they also have a flexibility that complements this ability. They like to figure out how all of the pieces and resources can be arranged for maximum productivity.

The reports you&#8217;re given are great. You get a myriad of tasks and actions to help you work on your strengths. That&#8217;s the point right? Do what you can do well&#8230; even better! Then it helps you develop a personal action plan.

I haven&#8217;t figured out my plan yet but I always enjoy learning more about myself. Knowing myself means I know my own needs and I can communicate them to my teammates, colleagues, bosses, etc. Talk about [win-win-win][4]!
