The dipthongs over at the world&#8217;s shittiest website, MySpace, have had the site inoperable/down since 6:30PST, it is now over 5 hours later and nothing is fixed. Needless to say, my site has received a lot of visits/comments on MySpace downtime from kids wondering whats up. Who&#8217;s going to make the MySpace killer? Just import people&#8217;s profile and friends (reserve a spot for them by email address until they make it over) and transfer all that information, it&#8217;d be genuis. MySpace doesn&#8217;t deserve a second (or 22nd for those of you keeping track) chance&#8230;
