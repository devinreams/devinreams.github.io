Here&#8217;s a good read from [Dustin][1]:

> If you have an album that you really canâ€™t wait to listen to, wait to listen to it. That is, until you can create an environment that allows for the music to be heard in the proper context.

Interesting point. I didn&#8217;t realize it until now but I always wait to buy new music until I&#8217;m near my studio-quality headphones. I rarely have a &#8220;first listen&#8221; with earbuds.
