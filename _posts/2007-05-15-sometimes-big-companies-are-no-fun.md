I&#8217;ve been an intern at a large company for over a year now. I&#8217;ve worked both part-time and full-time. I&#8217;ve seen the ins-and-outs, no doubt. That&#8217;s why I found [this article on CollegeHumor][1] so amusing. Going off to work at a big company after school can be sad, lonely and a waste of everyone&#8217;s time.

But, just because people don&#8217;t notice you doesn&#8217;t mean your time spent can&#8217;t be rewarding.

## Learn to prioritize

Sure, I may see my boss once or twice a day if I&#8217;m lucky (with a sum total of 4 minutes spent together). But, that gives me the freedom to get things done on my own schedule. If you don&#8217;t know how to prioritize and organize your time <span style="background-color:#ffff99">this is a great place to learn</span>. If you screw up a little, heck, there&#8217;s always tomorrow. Even better, people might not even notice.

## Work on meeting people

It may seem lonely in the fifth row, fourth cubicle on the right. In fact, it is. That&#8217;s why I make it a point to get up and go talk to a co-worker once an hour or so. No, nobody walks over to my desk and that&#8217;s fine. Many times in life <span style="background-color:#ffff99">you have to get up and take initiative</span> yourself. Or, yes, you can sit there and shoot off emails and chat online with friends from college talking about how your job sucks.

## Small companies aren&#8217;t any better

Have you tried working in an office of 4 people? It&#8217;s not all that it&#8217;s cracked up to be. Sure, it sounds entrepreneurial and dynamic but I&#8217;d argue it can be much worse than any big boring company you go work for.

*   **You have to do everything** &#8211; If you&#8217;re not the boss you&#8217;re going to end up doing a little bit of everyone&#8217;s job. This means less time focusing on what you like or what you want to learn.
*   **You mess up and everyone notices** &#8211; If there are only a handful of you and you make a mistake it doesn&#8217;t take much of a ripple to affect everyone else. Sure, you learn responsibility and more organization (maybe) but you also loose some flexibility.
*   **You might make less** &#8211; Sure, you don&#8217;t need much money to &#8220;get by&#8221; but if I have to work harder and later at a small company for the same pay as my friends working [9:17-4:45][1] two things happen. I have less time to spend that money and I am making less for each hour or unit of work I put in.

## So both suck?

I&#8217;m not saying working at a small company can&#8217;t be rewarding. I think we&#8217;ve all heard the argument that startups are fun, small companies allow flexibility, etc. My point is <span style="background-color:#ffff99">you could easily be upset no matter where you work</span>. You have to take the time to find the right fit for you.

Having just graduated I feel like [I&#8217;ve made the perfect choice][2]. In fact, I can&#8217;t think of a job I&#8217;d much rather have. <span style="background-color:#ffff99">I recommend getting out into the &#8220;real world&#8221;</span> through internships, summer jobs, and post-undergrad jobs to find what you like <span style="background-color:#ffff99">as soon as possible</span>. The sooner the better, right?
