	Whoops, it's already been another week. Here I am to revisit all the excitement that went on last week. With school starting there's obviously tons of great stuff to talk about...

	<!--more-->

	<h2>School</h2>

	I'm only taking four classes this semester (only needed three to graduate, ha!) and it's going to be nice having a lighter load this last semester of college.

	<h4>Ethics and Technology</h4>
	Should prove to be an interesting class. The class will end up co-authoring a published book in groups of two or three people per article. I like to write, I'm pretty versed in philosophy and technology -- this class shouldn't be an issue.

	<h4>Business Intelligence</h4>
	This class is dedicated to data, how it's acquired, organized, distributed, etc. Basically we'll learn about databases (already quite proficient) and then do some data mining projects. I'm so excited I fell asleep in this class (of 14) on the first day. Oops.

	<h4>School and Society</h4>
	This is a class in the education school. Little known fact: not very many guys in education. I'm quite certain there is a 23:6 girl to guy ratio in this class. Again, here's a somewhat philosophical class about school. There will be reading, a few projects, debating. No worries.

	<h4>Auditing and Assurance</h4>
	Oh yeah, I guess I'm an accounting major. This class is basically what I'll be doing starting in the fall. Working for a Big Four firm working on Technology Services and Risk Solutions. This is a different kind of accounting class. There aren't many number problems. It's more about methods and things of that nature. This has potential to be challenging.

	<h2>That's it...</h2>
	For the most part last week was just getting back into the swing of things. Getting schedules organized, books purchased, and so on. Until next week...
