I didn&#8217;t wait in line for an iPhone today. Largely because I&#8217;m on a great MyFaves Family Plan at T-Mobile. Oh, and I love my Pearl. But, today I&#8217;ve started something I attempted to do back in January: a daily video blog. Why? a) I hate failing and b) my favorite guys at [Viddler][1] are having a drawing to win an iPhone.
