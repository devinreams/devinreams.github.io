Our human resources team at GitHub is *very* good at making new employees feel welcome. When new hires start there are a number of meals and after-work events scheduled to help everyone meet their new teammates.

On April 23rd, thanks to @joewadcan's suggestion, about a dozen :octocat:s visited [1:AM SF](http://1amsf.com) and had a private graffiti class. Our teachers helped us create our own tag, spray it, and then create a number of murals and spray-painted t-shirts.

I've posted [photos of the GitHub Graffiti](http://photos.devin.reams.me/github-grafitti) over at [Exposure.so](http://exposure.so/).
