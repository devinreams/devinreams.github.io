I&#8217;ve had time to play with a new service called [edgeio][1]. Essentially, it&#8217;s a service that enables bloggers to post listings (job, help wanted, housing, etc.) to their blogs. Edgeio then crawls the blogs and finds the posts tagged &#8216;listing&#8217; and will aggregate them. The service is free to use but will also provide publishers with additional paid services (to help increase exposure).

At first glance the website is a lot to try and navigate. I found myself not noticing some things that I should have. For instance when creating an account it was not very clear to me how to pick my location. I finally figured out that not only do I have to put in the zip code/city but I then have to click the corresponding city that pops up. I figured by putting in the zip I had done my part. This registration process took three times becuase the error message at the top didn&#8217;t stand out. I didn&#8217;t realize the captcha changed each time. Haha, I do know how to use the interweb, I swear.

If you click the thumbnail you can see that the listing basically pulls the text (&#8216;I would like to sell&#8230;&#8217;) from the blog entry and any other information (price, location, tags). I had a few thoughts just looking at the listing though. For instance, when I &#8216;Subscribe&#8217; what kind of information is going to be sent via RSS? I also thought that the &#8216;report spam&#8217; button would be useful. But, I suspect (read: hope) edgeio will also have some mechanisms in place. I also like the fact that edgeio incorporates &#8216;Other Profiles&#8217; like ebay and flickr.

~~Here is my sample listing~~ which you can see to the right (the page where you manage the listing). Within a few seconds of adding my blog to my profile it had the listing added and a comfirmation email in my inbox. Managing listings are pretty straight forward. But, you can&#8217;t change any of the content through the edgeio website. From what I can tell all you&#8217;re able to do is change your tags, the listing status, and the price. I wasn&#8217;t able to determine whether or not an update to the blog means an update to the listing. I haven&#8217;t seen my update yet but they claim that once the blog is added it will routinely check up on it (every 24 hours). Luckily I can go to &#8216;My Edgeio&#8217; and hit &#8216;Check for new posts&#8217; under the appropriate blog. Interestingly enough my post was updated but I don&#8217;t see it on the page (it has the updates on the &#8216;Manage&#8217; page, though). Update: It just took a little while&#8230;

Anyway, I feel this will have some interesting implications on how individual business is done online. No longer do we have to pay a buck to put something on ebay. This seems like craigslist meets web2.0 meets blogs. I&#8217;m interested to see what the paid services consist of. I guess my final thought is: will the blogosphere catch on? Personally, I think if I had anything of substance (services, jobs, stuff for sale) to add I would certainly use edgeio. It&#8217;d be silly not to.
