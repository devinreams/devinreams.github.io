Yesterday the team and I at [Crowd Favorite][1] released our latest product offering: [a WordPress theme for personal sites and bloggers][2] that we built for, and use ourselves (that&#8217;s how you know it&#8217;s *really* good).

[<img src="http://devin.reams.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/socialhero-1-510x172.jpg" alt="" title="FavePersonal WordPress Theme by Crowd Favorite" width="510" height="172" class="alignright size-medium-img wp-image-3264" />][2]

It&#8217;s been in the works for over a year now and based around a few cornerstones:

*   you should be able to own your various types of content (status updates, photos, videos, links, quotes) and maintain those on your own website without succumbing to a service like Tumblr;
*   you should still be able to participate on the social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) where your friends participate;
*   you have the option easily customize the site to fit your style (custom color schemes using Adobe Kuler);
*   you should attractively showcase who you are and what you&#8217;re about (featured posts or photo in the header, Bio Widget with a profile and links)
*   and all this should be accessible from devices of all shapes and sizes (including mobile and tablet).

If you&#8217;re looking for a well-built, highly-designed WordPress theme for your own personal site (note: I also use it to run [cosnow.com][3]) I&#8217;d recommend you check out [FavePersonal][2]. It&#8217;s on sale now for only $49 which is a *steal* considering the average pricing of some of the other offerings out there and knowing it comes from one of the top WordPress design and development groups in the world (yes, I&#8217;ll toot our own horn).

I&#8217;ve thought a lot about how to &#8220;own&#8221; my content and how to create the simplest &#8220;social sharing&#8221; flow. The Path app is very close but it&#8217;s still closed down (I can&#8217;t easily get my content out) and it doesn&#8217;t offer the flexibility I want (photos should interact with Flickr or Instagram). FavePersonal is a step towards the ideal scenario. Expect more around this to come&#8230;
