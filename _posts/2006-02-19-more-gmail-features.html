I'm moving exclusively to Google Talk. Feel free to add devin.reams at gmail dot com. If I were to do the same analysis I did on <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/02/08/myspace-ads-suck/">MySpace ads</a> on an AIM chat window you'd be as frustrated as I am with wasted space. Anyway, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/?p=108">Garett has done more source-code investigating</a>. Interesting indeed. I'm even more interested by the fact that nobody really told me about Yahoo's voicemail capabilities.
