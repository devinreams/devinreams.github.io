Whilst the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ4pgcrJU8c">Google Street View snowmobile</a> is incredibly cool and innovative, I worry for the small companies that are building guides, videos, 3D trailmaps, and augmented reality applications for ski resorts. Once Google Maps introduces a new feature, it almost instantly becomes the de facto standard.
