I tend to write more &#8216;asides&#8217; (they&#8217;re the pink ones on here) than &#8216;articles&#8217;. I like concise writing but it takes more thought. I know people who write long-winded paragraphs and essays in email, blogs, 9rules notes, and comments. Do your readers (message receivers) a favor: the more to the point, the better responses you&#8217;ll get. I&#8217;m personally starting with this policy: [five.sentenc.es][1]. Can&#8217;t you be more brief?
