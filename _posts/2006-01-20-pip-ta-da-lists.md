I&#8217;ve always used Outlook to schedule my time and keep myself on task but I&#8217;ve found that &#8216;Calendar&#8217; and &#8216;Tasks&#8217; don&#8217;t do much for me. The interfaces seem outdated and not as easy to mange as I&#8217;d like. This is why I actually designed my &#8216;weekly schedule&#8217; in Excel. Although Outlook helps me look ahead, it doesn&#8217;t help me look at my days very easily.

I also found that &#8216;Tasks&#8217; don&#8217;t do much for me. I don&#8217;t know, but I decided to try out [37 signals][1]&#8216; [Ta-da lists][2]. The lists are great because I can create a bunch of different subjects (Classes, Work, Projects) and just drop tasks into it. I can quickly and easily arrange the order and then check them off when I&#8217;m done.

In addition, each list has a dot next to it which is a graphical representation of what needs to be done. A quick glance tells me I have a lot of magazines to read, a few books to finish and a bunch of tasks to do at work. On the other hand, I don&#8217;t have as much course work yet. This serves as a nice reminder that even though X is easier, Y has a lot more than needs to be done. Also, I know which lists are priority so I can quickly look at those before anything else (instead of a mashed collection of tasks).

Going back to what I said earlier, I have all sorts of empty space on my calendar so when I find myself just chatting online I quickly reference my lists. I also made a list of my classes which I can then email to people or myself in case I forget. Lists are so good for me, I&#8217;m getting a ton done lately&#8230; I caught up on 4 magazines last night!
