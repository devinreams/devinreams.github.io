I just wanted to post this article by Ramit because, well, **I love it**. It?s called [Your College is Not a Technical School][1]. I realize its a bit old but I re-read it today and whole-heartedly agree with everything it has to offer. In fact, it inspired me to add a few things to my [quotes page][2].
