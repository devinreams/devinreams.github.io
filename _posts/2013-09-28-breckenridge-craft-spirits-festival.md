I continue to contribute guest posts over at the [Breck Connection blog][1] and my latest is about the upcoming [Craft Spirits Festival to be held in Breckenridge next weekend][2]. Go check it out!

I&#8217;m bummed that I can&#8217;t make it myself (I&#8217;ll be in Maine at [Monktoberfest][3], so, I still win) but would encourage anyone interested in imbibing to check it out.
