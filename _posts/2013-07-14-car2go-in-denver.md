I was one of the earliest to register for [B-Cycle][1] (Denver&#8217;s bike sharing system) and now I&#8217;m excited to sign up for [car2go in Denver][2].

Different from some existing car sharing services (which I&#8217;ve also tried), car2go has worked out a local &#8216;zone&#8217; where if you park on the street (even in metered areas), you can leave the car there instead of being tied to specific parking lots of spots in the city. So, I can literally park in front of my house after taking a trip and use the app to find the nearest car (which may be in my neighborhood or on the same street where I work). It&#8217;s a great service and made me think of this quote:

> A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It&#8217;s where the rich use public transportation â€” Enrique Penalosa, Mayor of Bogota 

For a limited time, the $35 registration fee is waived if you use offer code &#8220;ROCKIES&#8221;. [Check out car2go in Denver.][3]
