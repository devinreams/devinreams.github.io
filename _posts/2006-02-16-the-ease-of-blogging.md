I was doing some quality thinking in the shower (my best ideas originate while soaking in hot water). I was reflecting on my blogging experience. Why do I do it? Why do other people do it? Is there an easy way to explain it? I think I figured out the answer to most of these questions. It&#8217;s really quite simple. I submit to you the underlying principles of blogging which I like to call ***The Ease (E&#8217;s) of Blogging***:

*   **Educate**
*   **Entertain**
*   **Emote**
*   **Engage**
*   **Earn**

Blogging is as simple as the aforementioned activities. For example, [Robert Scoble][1] is great at doing all of the above: he blogs as an evangelist (earning his paycheck); Robert educates his readers about Microsoft and technology; in addition he uses his blog to express his opinions which quickly lead to engaging conversations.

Blogs like [Engadget][2] are dedicated to educating and entertaining their readers.

People like [Bryan Veloso][3] are great at entertaining readers.

Individuals like [Paul Stamatiou][4] are great at educating readers with both news and tutorial-style posts.

Other personal bloggers, such as myself, frequently emote ([MySpace sucks][5], [Yahoo has no clue][6], etc) and try to engage their readers. I don&#8217;t try to earn a living like some educators ([Darren Rowse][7]) but I do try to earn respect and recognition. I&#8217;m also trying to earn the companionship and readership of some of the brightest people on the internet.

*The Ease of Blogging* explains why you see thousands of new blogs every day with thousands of posts every second, it&#8217;s just so easy&#8230;

&#8230;but what seperates the best bloggers from the rest? We&#8217;re all doing the same things aren&#8217;t we?
