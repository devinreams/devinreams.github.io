[The Monktoberfest][1], my favorite conference at the confluence of technology and beer, is back for 2013 in lovely Portlane, Maine. [Tickets just went on sale][2] and there&#8217;s only a few dozen left. Prior speakers and companies in attendance include ZenDesk, GitHub, Untappd, Mozilla, Facebook, and more.

Here&#8217;s some [photos from the inaugural Monktoberfest in 2011][3].
