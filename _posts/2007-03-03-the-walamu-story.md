[Rohail Rizvi][1] introduced me to a website he has been working on while in college: [Walamu][2]. Walamu is posed to become a successful college marketplace with classifieds and textbook sales (local to universities). Rohail is a student at Rutgers and a member of a very neat young entrepreneur group called [Mind Petals][3]. I liked his story enough to look into Walamu a bit more&#8230;

<!--more-->

First off, Walamu does not come across as YACTS (Yet Another Cheap Textbook Site). Walamu is structured more like a Craigslist for colleges. Although Rutgers is the only college on the site right now it seems to have become popular with the students. Oh, and go take a look at the site&#8217;s [blog][4]. As of this writing, they&#8217;re offering a free night with a stripper to a lucky classifieds poster. Who else does that? Who else *has* done that? Wow.

Additionally, you look at the site and it looks professional, it looks clean, it seems functional. Most textbook and classified sites I&#8217;ve seen (including Craigslist) are *too* simple and *too* empty. Sure, you need a community and you need an easy-enough site to get to the point: exchanging of goods and services.

But, you look at this site and it looks great, it looks like a lot of time and resources have been put into it. Well, yes. But would you believe that one guy (named Rohail) is behind it **all**? The same Rohail who is still [going through college, eating Ramen, and having a hard time finding money to purchase textbooks][5].

I like what Rohail has done with Walamu; it&#8217;s the perfect entrepreneur story. **He&#8217;s found a problem that he deeply understands and he has created a solution.** I think a lot of people, including students, can look at this story and realize that, yes, I can create something. I can go out and *do* things no matter the limitations.

Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t create a [YACTS-competitor][6] though. ;)
