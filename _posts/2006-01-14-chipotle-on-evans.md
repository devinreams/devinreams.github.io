I felt some history in my veins today. I visited the Chipotle on Evans and Gilpin (in Denver) today. For those of you not ?up? on your burrito facts, this was the original Chipotle and its a few blocks away from the DU Campus. First off, its **very** small. Second, the lady making your burrito isn?t right in front of you like the newer restaurants. You have to shout to her back in the kitchen, essentially. Third, the line is always out the door. Fourth, almost nobody stays and eats in the restaurant. Fifth, their storage room is under the restaurant; there?s a trap door/stairs to it right in front of the bathroom. Basically, the restaurant has definitely evolved a bit away from the original.
