Hah, I have one of the coolest bosses ever. I use the term &#8216;boss&#8217; a big liberally because I only work a few hours a month with him. [Jeremy Wright][1], author, entreprentur, blogger, and all-around cool guy has [reflected on his last 6 months][2] running [his (very successful) blog network][3]. How do I know it&#8217;s successful? I&#8217;m the guy who crunches the numbers and tells Jeremy how much to pay each of his 50-plus bloggers. I almost forgot blogging could be so lucrative (I shoot to earn $1/day with my Adsense). In any case, I appreciated his mention. From one guy to another I realize how tricky it may be to express any kind of feelings so I appreciate his&#8230; appreciation. I, too, look forward to the next 6 months.
