A [WhiteHouse.gov petition][1]:

> States should not be allowed to prevent Tesla Motors from selling cars directly to customers. The state legislators are trying to unfairly protect automobile dealers in their states from competition. Tesla is providing competition, which is good for consumers. 

I&#8217;ve never appreciated the laws and relationships between car manufacturers, dealers, etc. I want to buy my cars directly. The established groups typically require legislation to maintain the status quo and I&#8217;d certainly like cars to be &#8216;disrupted&#8217; by a company like Tesla.

I feel the same is starting to happen in the [alcohol industry][2]&#8230;
