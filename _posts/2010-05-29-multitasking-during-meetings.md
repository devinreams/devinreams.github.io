On multitasking during a conference call:

> Well, I sent the client the message. Then I had to send him another one, this time with the attachment I had forgotten to append. Finally, my third email to him explained why that attachment wasn’t what he was expecting. When I eventually refocused on the call, I realized I hadn’t heard a question the Chair of the Board had asked me.

I see this (and do it) on a daily basis. It&#8217;s about time to consciously put [destructive multitasking][1] to an end.
