I swear, any time that I decide I want to check out MySpace (only means of communication with some in-duh-viduals) it&#8217;s broken. I click a page, it says &#8220;error, under maintainance&#8221; I say &#8220;liar&#8221; and refresh and, wow, page magically loads. For being one of the most popular websites *ever* how the fuck is this acceptable? If someone is making a MySpace killer, for goodness sakes, email me and let&#8217;s fix this?
