I was looking at [David Seah][1]&#8216;s **excellent** [tools][2] the other day. I was inspired. I had been thinking about revising my daily schedule and I came up with the following tool in Excel: the **Linear Week Schedule**.

<p align="center">
  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/121128081/"><img width="240" height="97" border="0" alt="filled" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/121128081_26a7477f9d_m.jpg" /></a>
</p>

I basically laid out the week in 30 minute blocks. Each row is 6 hours. Now you can see the entire week starting at midnight on Sunday. This seemed useful since our days run into one another (and I know my day doesn&#8217;t stop at midnight). This is what David did with his [Compact Schedule][3]. It shows the week along a line, not in seven seperate chunks. I found his idea to be pure genius&#8230;

  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/121128083/"><img width="240" height="121" border="0" alt="withnote" src="http://static.flickr.com/41/121128083_b245afebc2_m.jpg" /></a>
</p>

As you can see there&#8217;s plenty of whitespace for leaving notes, a todo, etc. I figure I can use this space for all the extra notes and things I need to get done throughout the week. Plus, I can get into more detail if needed (meeting location, time, room number).

</p>

I also tried using Excel to color-code my regular events (sleep, eat, school, etc). This way I can see at a glance when I&#8217;m planning on doing certain things. At the same time, there&#8217;s room to include written events if need be.

<p align="center">
  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devdev/121128082/"><img width="180" height="240" border="0" alt="fullview" src="http://static.flickr.com/29/121128082_61b5a54307_m.jpg" /></a>
</p>

Obviously, this can be as detailed or as simple as you&#8217;d like. Be creative and let me know if you found this useful. I was just toying around and figured somebody else might be able to use it. Anyway, I&#8217;m off to start planning out my week&#8230;
