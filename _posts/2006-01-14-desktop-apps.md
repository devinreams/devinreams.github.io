Over on [BusinessBits][1] I asked why we don?t see enough ?desktop web apps? (or is it web desktop apps?) out there these days? Well? [Lifehacker has posted a very useful one][2]. It puts input boxes on your desktop and you can press Alt-W to search Wikipedia, Alt-G, Google, etc. This is exactly the useful stuff I?m looking for! Anyone know of other cool things like this?
