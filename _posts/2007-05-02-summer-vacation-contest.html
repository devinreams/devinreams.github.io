I have a burning question and I want you all to help me find an answer:

	<center><b>If you could do <em>anything</em> this summer, what would it be and why?</b><b></b></center>

	One small caveat, your idea has to take place within 200 miles of your residence and cost under $500. <em>Top 3 Prizes</em>: Your choice of an invite to <a href="http://iminlikewithyou.com/">iminlikewithyou.com</a>, an invite to <a href="http://joost.com/">Joost</a>, or $15 <a href="http://paypal.com/">cash</a>. <!--more-->

	<b>Update: Winners!</b> My favorite <a href="http://9rules.com/personal/notes/3598/">responses</a> were from LorriM (head South and do spur-of-the-moment stuff), Auburn (go camping with my sweetie), and Carmodyarc (go spend a day at Tattered Cover). Thanks to everyone who made over a dozen awesome suggestions! (Special hat tip to ryanarrowsmith. Wink.)
