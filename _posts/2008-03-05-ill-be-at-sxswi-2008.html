For those of you who don't speak nerd, I'm going to the South-by-Southwest Conference in Austin, TX on Friday (through Tuesday). I'll be attending the 'Interactive' conference which is a lot of people from the internet who think they're forward thinking, amazing individuals.

In reality, it's a lot of parties put on by a lot of hot new companies (everyone from Google to my Boulder buddies at <a href="http://www.socialthing.com/">socialthing!</a>). Drinks, nerds, how can it go wrong?

I know a lot of cool people will be there (speaking and attending) and if you'll be there too be sure to let me know:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Phone:</strong> 303-835-3512</li>
	<li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:devin@reams.com">devin@reams.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/devinreams">devinreams</a></li>
</ul>

See you guys there.
