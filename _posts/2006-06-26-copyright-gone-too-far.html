I wanted to get some information on <a href="http://www.tourgasm.com/">Tourgasm</a>, Dane Cook's cleverly named comedy tour. When I visited the <a href="http://www.tourgasm.com"><b>official</b> website</a> I was greeted with "The <strong>official</strong> trailer for the brand new HBO Comedy Documentary Series - Tourgasm!" When you hit Play you're told the video has been removed for, get this, copyright infringement! YouTube, you piece of shit. You removed the <strong>official</strong> trailier. Look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search=tourgasm&search_type=search_videos&search=Search">all these bootleg videos</a>! I'm sorry but I had to go to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tourgasm">MySpace</a> to watch the trailers. You know you're done when MySpace does better than you...
