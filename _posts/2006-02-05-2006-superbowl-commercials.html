Being a Denver fan (and resident) I felt it was only necessary to root for the guys who beat us (Steelers). My logic brings me to the conclusion that we were #3 this season. Way to grab the bronze, Broncos! Anyway, I was simultanously doing other things during the game tonight but luckily I can <a href="http://www.devlib.org/blog/2006/01/30/2006-super-bowl-commercials/">download all the commercials into iTunes</a>. PS: How cute was that clydesdale one?
