I haven&#8217;t had time to check out the new hit show, Heroes, on NBC but I hear it&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s a show about ordinary citizens that realize they have supernatural powers. Wow. Of course its a hit, X-Men was, too. Seriously, the [Heroes blog][1] doesn&#8217;t seem to appreciate people making the connection. If you ask me, the premise is identical. The reason people seem to enjoy this show a bit more is the overwhelming amounts of drama and lack of goofy superhero costumes. At least, that&#8217;s my guess.

I&#8217;d also venture to say people enjoy a show like this because it allows us to escape. We think &#8220;wow that&#8217;d be neat if I had some sort of power.&#8221; Why? Is there a reason we need an advantage over others? Do some of us feel cheated and need something that others don&#8217;t have? I wonder&#8230;

Instead of fantasizing over individuals with unrealistic powers why don&#8217;t we have shows highlighting amazing people who are the same as you and I? Would that make us feel insignificant? Are we incapable of doing great things and don&#8217;t want to be reminded of it? I wonder&#8230;

Personally, I don&#8217;t have these issues because I know I have a power. I destroy light bulbs. In the last 24 hours I&#8217;ve broken two light bulbs. Two lamps on my desk burnt out. I thought it was odd so I tried a bulb in another lamp. I underestimated my own strength and broke the bulb in my hand. The next morning I went to the garage and that light burnt out, too. Perhaps it&#8217;s not a superpower, perhaps I&#8217;m just so strong and scary the bulbs tremble when I&#8217;m about.

I guess I like to fantasize too&#8230;
