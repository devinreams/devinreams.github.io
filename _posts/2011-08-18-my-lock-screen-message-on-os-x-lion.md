I added a &#8220;screen is locked&#8221; message (new to \[OS X Lion\](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) under System Preferences > Security &#038; Privacy) to my laptop since I&#8217;m traveling. It says:

<a href="http://devin.reams.me/2011/my-lock-screen-message-on-os-x-lion/photo-8/" rel="attachment wp-att-2168"><img src="http://devin.reams.me/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo1-e1313683185890-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="OS X Lion &quot;locked screen&quot; message" width="224" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2168" /></a>

> &#8220;Hard Drive is encrypted. If found, please contact 303-835-3512&#8243;

This helps me get a few points across: the drive is encrypted so you can&#8217;t steal this to check your email and screw around, I want you to contact me (without explicitly stating there is a reward, or incentive to steal it), I am savvy enough to add a message like this so you think this is a risky laptop to steal.

Do you think this communicates the right message? What would (do) you say on your lock screen?

I&#8217;m afraid it may also suggest &#8220;don&#8217;t bother trying to hack this, just dump the hard drive and sell it&#8221; which would slow down any tracking or recovery efforts.
