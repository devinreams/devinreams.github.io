<p>Not too shabby. The acting was a bit corny. I realize this movie has to cater to the lowest common denomenator. You really didn't have to think much, it was all handed to you on a platter. Not only do they hint at something once, but they make sure to revisit it later in case you forgot... or were asleep the first time.</p>
<p>Much of it was overdramatic. Additionally, there was so many "big" things thrown around in this plot; it seemed to be trying too hard.</p>
<p>Overall it was fun. Slight humor here and there. A bit of drama. Lots of exploding. It was fun to revisit the story again but I'm probably going to forget how this one goes just like I did the last two. Seriously, I totally forgot who Jean was for a minute.</p>
<p>Oh, and stick around for the very very ending. There's a tad more after the credits...</p>
