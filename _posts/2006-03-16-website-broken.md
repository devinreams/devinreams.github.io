If you&#8217;re reading this you&#8217;re subscribed to my feed and not reading from my website. My provider is very broken and I&#8217;m very not happy. Then again, I don&#8217;t pay anything for it. Sigh. Anyone have any ideas? I was more upset about my email, though. If anything was sent in the last 5 days and I haven&#8217;t responded please re-send.
