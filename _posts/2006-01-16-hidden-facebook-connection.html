While busily checking up on friends today I decided to snoop around on Facebook. Long story short, I found the following options (hidden) from everyone's friends details. These two options aren't currently accessible but are definitely in the 'facebook code' under 'Met Through Facebook': <em>Is a Facebook whore, Never spoken in real life</em>. Interested in more random Facebook facts? I found a whole bunch of good ones over at <a href="http://thebillygoatcurse.com/43/">TheBillyGoatCurse.com</a>. Yes, I do have a problem...
