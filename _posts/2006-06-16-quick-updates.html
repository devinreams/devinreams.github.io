<p>Vacation was great, I got lots of naps. Road trips are cool like that. Plus, it got me away from the record heat here in Colorado (something like 95+ for the last few days). Anyway, I had plenty of time to do some thinking and sort out my thoughts. Once I got back I started calling all kinds of people and started working on some projects:
</p>
<ul><li>One is a web comic,</li><li>One is a podcast,</li><li>One is a website for musicians,</li><li>One is a CRM website with a twist,</li><li>One is a little badge/applet for bloggers, and</li><li>One is re-organizing and re-energizing <a href="http://yopos.com/">yopos</a>.</li></ul>
<p>There's just so much to do. Plus I work maybe 60-70 hours a week. Busy busy! Oh, and then there's having a life; I'll be playing DDR with a friend tonight. I guess that doesn't count though...</p>
<p>...unfortunately I didn't read as much as I had hoped. How ironic is it that I didn't get around to finishing <em>Getting Things Done</em>?)</p>
<p>PS: Congratulations to all <a href="http://9rules.com/blog/2006/06/round-4-list/">the new 9rulers</a>!</p>
