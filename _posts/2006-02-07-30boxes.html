Is anyone out there playing with <a href="http://www.30boxes.com/">30boxes</a>? If so, <a href="mailto:devin@devinreams.com">email me</a> if you'd like to play with the 'buddy' features. If not, go to <a href="http://www.30boxes.com/">30boxes.com</a> and sign up... then re-read this post starting at 'If so'... At first glance this kick-ass-calendar seems to be just that (and more).
