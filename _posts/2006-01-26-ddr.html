Another day of coincidences: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/25/dance_dance_revoluti.html">DDR will be introduced to schools to fight obesity</a>. Any opposition should <a href="http://avalonstar.com/2006/01/25/welcome-back-ddr-and-a-meme/">watch Bryan</a> and notice how un-obese he is. Hah for that matter they could look at skinny ol' me playing DDR. ;-)
