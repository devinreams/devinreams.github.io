Odds are you are, or know someone who is in the restaurant business. From what I've been told this movie exposes many of the finer details to handling other people's food.

Oh, wait, it's not just some dumb movie about some disgruntled waiters. There are 'guy' jokes left and right. Personally, I'm surprised with what they can get away with these days.  In addition, the main character's struggle is with deciding on whether or not sleeping with the 17-year old hostess is moral (not to mention legal) or not. Classy, to say the least. That's okay though, Ryan Renolds is the coolest actor around (Van Wilder, anyone?).

Being a male, aged 16-25, I found many parts of this movie to be extremely humerous. It's not something I'd have a girl come watch with me, that's for sure. Though, that doesn't mean many wouldn't enjoy it.

In any case, the inside look at what it's really like to 'wait' tables is very funny. I'd recommed it to any guys who share similar humor tastes (Family Guy, Simpsons, Van Wilder). I'd have to give 'Waiting' a 5/10; it's disgusting, immature, but pretty darned entertaining...
