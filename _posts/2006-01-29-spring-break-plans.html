Another dual-purpose post. First off, Facebook has added 'Spring Break Plans' to profiles so you can let your friends know how cool you are. Personally, I'm tossing around the idea of going to Spain. I have a friend studying in Barcelona and I figure it would fun. Anyway, I hope my friends check my profile and realize how cool that makes me.
