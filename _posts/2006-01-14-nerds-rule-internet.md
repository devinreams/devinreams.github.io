It?s been pointed out before how the nerds become the popular results on search engines. Scoble beats De Niro on Google? What has this world come to! In any case, to help my ego this evening I decided to see where I ranked among the ?devins? in the world. Oddly enough there are more than you?d think (and plenty more Devons). In any case, <a target="_blank" href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=devin&#038;FORM=QBRE">MSN</a> puts me as the #3 devin, <a target="_blank" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=devin&#038;sm=Yahoo%21+Search&#038;toggle=1&#038;ei=UTF-8&#038;pstart=1&#038;fr=FP-tab-web-t&#038;b=11">Yahoo</a> at #11, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=devin&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;safe=off&#038;start=20&#038;sa=N">Google</a> has me all the way down at #22. Not bad, considering I just ?restarted? this site? I guess. But the thing I don?t entirely understand is why the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/">DenverPost</a> has bought my name for Adwords. Seriously. Search <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;safe=off&#038;q=Devin+Reams&#038;btnG=Search">devin reams</a> and you?ll see me under the sponsored links. Maybe it has to do with me being part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpostbloghouse.com/">DenverPost Bloghouse</a>?
