Kudos to the team at [Lift][1] for launching their iOS app today:

> [Lift][1] is a simple way to achieve any goal, track your progress, and get the support of your friends.

Rachel and I used to have a website many years ago where we tracked our goals and would encourage each other (&#8220;Nice work on yoga, you get an exercise check today&#8221;) and Lift is now the well-designed, simple app that I&#8217;ve been looking for as a replacement. Here&#8217;s my concise review:

> This app has become a part of my daily routine. It&#8217;s helped me become more regular at the stuff I know I should do but &#8220;forget to&#8221; (looking at you, flossingâ€¦). It&#8217;s also a fun way to track habits and activities and then visualize it (I thought I ran more than I did). I&#8217;d recommend this app to anyone.
