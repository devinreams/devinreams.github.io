Hi my name is Devin and I'm a workaholic.

I think it all started when I arrived at college (last year). I had only worked two jobs in my life (a lifeguard and retail sales) and I realized there had to be something better. Once I found stuff I really liked I did a lot of it. Now I'm a workaholic. <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/01/18/sleep-cycles/">I've even changed my entire sleep schedule</a> to try and get the most out of every hour in the day.

In fact, even though I have all kinds of stuff on my plate (school, three jobs, life) I wish there were more. I guess I get bored easily. I want to move quickly from one thing to the next. I think I want to do everything I can until I find something worth 'settling down'.
Unlike Shivani's point (society, jobs, raises) I think my workaholism is driven primarily by my own self-motivation (not to say she isn't driven). I'm saying that I don't necessairly work a lot becuase society has told me to be that way. I didn't play the whole 4.0-in-high-school game nor do I play it now. No, I didn't apply to 37 different schools. I simply did (and still do) what I want(ed) to do.

Now that I sit and think about it, I don't know exactly what 'self-motivates' me. It's clearly not the pay. It can't be any perks or benefits. I think I just like to synthesize. I like to create things or do things that I can later point to with pride. People think I'm crazy but, hell, I like doing it.

This may be (one of many reasons) why I don't have a girlfriend, though...
