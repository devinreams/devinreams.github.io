I really despise our public school systems. For someone as un-smart as myself I&#8217;ve figured out how to &#8220;beat&#8221; them&#8230; that says a lot. Oh, and (as mentioned in Paul Graham&#8217;s article) [our schools act more like prisons][1]. Oh, and [now we&#8217;re only going to teach the few things fom the national tests][2]. Oh, and I can go on all night. Excuse the blunt remark but as far as education (and remaining competitive) is concerned: the U.S. is **fucked**.
