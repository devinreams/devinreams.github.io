Okay, I know I have a problem, but I was 'poking' around on Facebook today (pun intended) and I usually click around and see if I can find anything new. It's kinda hard to find out if there's a change anywhere becuase Facebook doesn't have a blog or anything (ahem, Noah?) but that's okay, I clicked on 'My Privacy' today and bam!, it's different. I refreshed the home page like 20 times and haven't seen any mention on the 'Next Step' either.

I hated this page because it was like, 2047 check boxes with 32 different radio buttons to select. But now it's narrowed our privacy settings down to 'Normal', 'Reserved', 'Paranoid' or a custom mixture of options.

This seems like one of those little things, but for some it's kinda a big deal. With a lot more people jumping on the site now (alumni, staff, even parents!) it'd be nice to make sure you can be as open as you want without the whole world knowing about you.

It also looks like you don't need to know a person's email address if you want to block them anymore. It'll do a search for you and let you select them to be blocked. This is much simpler and almost one of those no-brainers... it's about time.

Also, for those who aren't yet married yet but are planning on it, it looks like 'Engaged' has been added to the relationship status. Very exciting! I'm sure this applies to plenty of people. I already added a girl friend of mine as 'Engaged'.

Since she already accepted it I don't think I need to buy a ring...
