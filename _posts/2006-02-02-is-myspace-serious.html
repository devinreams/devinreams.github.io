<script language="JavaScript"> 			//<!-- 			var mydate=new Date(); 			document.write(mydate.getMonth()+1 + '/' + mydate.getDate() + '/' + mydate.getFullYear()); 			// --> 			</script>I may regret saying this but: what the fuck, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">myspace</a>? I tried to log in to it today <a href="http://devinreams.com/2006/01/14/myspace-login-disabled/">for the second time</a> and it was down. You either hate me, your users, or some mixture of both. "Login is temporarily disabled while we fix some database problems.  We'll be back shortly. 			 2/2/2006" So many questions flow through my mind at this point. What happens to the people already logged in? Why can I see every other part of the site except the one page that says 'processing login'? What can really be wrong with the database that this one function has to be disabled? Why is this site so damn ugly? So on and so forth... why don't people demand better service from one of the largest websites in the world? Teenagers are the last people I'd expect to be so complacent...
