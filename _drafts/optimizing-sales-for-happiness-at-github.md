title: Optimizing Sales for Happiness at GitHub
layout: post
---

Structure:

- customer ops
- sales ops
- special ops

Mechanics:

- shared inbox / ticketing
- repository (issues, PRs)
- chat

Schedule:

- currently: US business hours
- some overlap with asia and europe
- rorate through conferences, meetings, calls

Philosophies:

- we don't compete to be lowest price
- keep pricing transparent, not a starting point for negotiation
- not every deal needs to be made
- inversely, invest time in every conversation
- similarly, no commissions, big deal or small deal may require same work
- most people know they want GitHub, the rest are trying to compare and understanding (VCS, Git systems)

We are currently looking for a Technical Account Manager to join us in Japan (front line, technical, but with sales and support experience), a Sales Operations Analyst to join us in San Francisco for (document processes, support reporting), and an Implementations Specialist (visit companies and understand their desired workflow, then make it happen).
