Apple needs help doing data, cloud, synch, search, etc. 

Amazon is very good at this and can make good money.

They compete on digital goods and devices, but Apple has had stranger relationships (Microsoft investment, Samsung chips).

The enemy of my enemy (Google) is my friend. Coming after selling goods, delivery, cloud.
