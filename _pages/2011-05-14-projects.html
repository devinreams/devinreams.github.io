<h2><a href="http://cosnow.com">Colorado Snow Blog</a></h2>

I started writing about the stuff I was doing when I went skiing. It turned into talking about products, reviews, answering questions about things to do in the mountains, tracking upcoming events, writing perspective pieces and so on. The site has continued to grow in size and scope and its fun to maintain.

<h2>WordPress Plugins</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Minty: I created a <em>very</em> lightweight WordPress Plugin to add <a href="http://haveamint.com">Mint</a> analytics tracking into to a site's header (e.g.: the /mint/?js file). Download available at <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/minty/">WordPress.org</a> and maintained on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/devinreams/wp-minty">https://github.com/devinreams/wp-minty</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Save to foursquare WordPress Shortcode: A very simple shortcode created for myself to add the "Save to foursquare" button to WordPress posts (when referencing a venue). Download available at <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/save-to-foursquare-shortcode/">WordPress.org</a> and maintained on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/devinreams/wp-save-to-foursquare-shortcode">https://github.com/devinreams/wp-save-to-foursquare-shortcode</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Mentorship</h2>

<ul>
<li>I currently serve as an advisor to the team at <a href="http://elihuu.com">Elihuu</a>, an early-stage startup in the TechStars Boulder 2013 class.</li>
</ul>
